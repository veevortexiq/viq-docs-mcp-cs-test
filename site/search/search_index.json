The Command Centre is not a passive reporting tool \u2014 it is an active, AI-powered workspace. Unlike traditional dashboards that display historical data you must interpret manually, the Command Centre surfaces real-time alerts, AI-generated recommendations, and a conversational interface that lets you ask questions and take action in the same place. It is the difference between reading a report and having a senior analyst at your side at all times.</p> <p>Q: Can I access the Command Centre on mobile devices? Yes. The Vortex IQ Command Centre is a fully responsive web application, accessible from any modern browser on desktop, tablet, or mobile. For the best experience managing agents and reviewing detailed reports, a desktop or laptop screen is recommended.</p> <p>Q: Why do some Vortex Apps show an upgrade prompt? App access is gated by your subscription plan. Apps shown with an upgrade prompt are not included in your current plan. Click the upgrade prompt to see the plan that includes that app, or contact the Vortex IQ support team to discuss options for your workspace.</p> <p>Q: Does the Chat History persist between sessions? Yes. Every conversation with Ask Viq is saved to your Chat History. You can reload any previous thread from the right panel's Chat History tab, allowing you to continue a previous analysis or share context with a team member.</p> <p>Q: How does the AI Agent Library differ from the Agent Hub? The AI Agent Library in the Command Centre's left panel shows a curated catalogue of agents available for quick activation \u2014 optimised for discovery.

There is no code to write, no files to configure, and no developer required at any point.</p> <p>Q: What is the difference between \"Get Magic Link\" and signing up with Google? Both are passwordless and highly secure. \"Get Magic Link\" sends a one-time secure link to your email \u2014 click it to sign in with no password required. \"Sign up with Google\" uses your existing Google Workspace credentials to authenticate instantly. Google sign-in is the fastest option if you already use Google at work.</p> <p>Q: Can I connect multiple stores to one account? Yes. Partner Accounts are designed to manage multiple client storefronts from a single workspace, each with its own isolated data and agent configuration. Merchant Accounts support a primary store with the ability to add additional platform integrations from Settings at any time.</p> <p>Q: What happens to my data if I cancel my subscription? Your workspace data is retained for 30 days after cancellation, giving you time to export reports or reconnect if you change your mind.

Ask Viq is reactive \u2014 it answers your questions on demand in a conversational interface. Vortex Mind is proactive \u2014 it generates comprehensive, structured intelligence reports across multiple sections of your business, either on demand or on an automated schedule. The two are complementary: Ask Viq is your analyst on call; Vortex Mind is your scheduled strategic briefing.</p> <p>Q: Can I schedule reports to deliver automatically? Yes. The Scheduled Reports feature within Vortex Mind lets you configure daily, weekly, or monthly report delivery. Each schedule specifies which store to analyse, which sections to include, and what date range logic to apply. Reports are generated automatically and added to your View Reports history at the configured interval.</p> <p>Q: Does Vortex Mind support multiple stores in the same report? Each report is scoped to a single connected store. If you manage multiple storefronts, you can create separate report configurations \u2014 or separate schedules \u2014 for each. Partner Account users can access Vortex Mind independently for each client workspace using the workspace switcher.</p> <p>Q: What is the Podcast section in a Vortex Mind report? When you include the Podcast section in your report configuration, Vortex Mind generates a downloadable audio summary of the full intelligence briefing alongside the written document. This allows you or your leadership team to consume the report as an audio briefing \u2014 useful for remote teams, commuting, or situations where a full document review is not practical.</p> <p>Q: How far back can I run a Vortex Mind report? The date range is configurable at the time of report generation. Historical data availability depends on how long your connected platforms have been linked to your workspace.

After giving Admin access to StagingPro Git repository, I see some autogenerated code branches e.g., Productione347c1, so should I keep the names as they are?A1. Yes, that is correct. These environment branch names are autogenerated and required for code commit tracking. Please do not delete or rename these branches as it will affect the GitHub integration.</p> <p>The branches are created -</p> <p>i) per environment</p> <p>ii) per channel</p> <p>iii) per team member</p> <p>Q2. What is the purpose of developer branches?A2. As best practice, developers are given their own branches so they can commit their codes to their own branch at the first instance, or for more frequent code commits at the developers convenience without affecting the environment branch.</p> <p>Q3. Are there any benefits to using a developer branch over a more typical git feature branch (e.g. feature/TICKET-description-of-the-change)?A3. Yes indeed! The developer can commit to their branch first. Once the task is complete, they can merge the code from their branch to the environment branch. If many developers are working on a common task, they can commit codes to each of their individual branches without affecting the other developer branches. And can merge their code easily.</p> <p>Q4. What purpose does the Main/Master branch serve in a typical setup? A4. Master branch is generally used as a buffer branch and is the default branch while creating a repo in GitHub. This master \u2018buffer\u2019 branch can be left as it is. Instead use the autogenerated active branches that is automatically (with a name such as Productione347c1) created during your GitHub integration and linking process.</p> <p>Q5. Is there a way to export from Bigcommerce to Github through StagingPro, or do I need to download the current theme through storefront and upload it to Github separately?A5. As long as GitHub integration is connected and at a minimum, one team member user is added in the \u2018Settings\u2019 section, then yes - StagingPro automatically downloads the theme into the connected branch.</p> <p>Q6. When I commit changes in Github, will those changes will appear as rollback options in StagingPro?A6. Correct. After the GitHub integration is set, commit changes are tracked and rollback options are visible on the deployments grid.</p> <p>Q7. Can you explain how version control works for StagingPro with multiple development teams as part of existing CI/CD pipelines? A7. When you successfully configure the GitHub integration on your StagingPro tenant, your GIT commits will be visible on the \u2018Code Deployment\u2019 tab which displays incremental version numbers. The code branches are created i) per environment ii) per channel and iii) per repo team member. Refer the StagingPro Git Branch workflow section of this document. Under Settings &gt; Status Notifications you can enable the Deployment Notifications checkbox for team notifications through i) Email ii) Teams and iii) Slack for shared visibility and effective collaboration.</p> <p>Q8. Launching preview is not generating preview URL quickly, why?A8. Depending on the theme file size, generating the preview URL may take up to 5 minutes, as it requires launching a temporary server and installing the theme.</p> <p>Q9. After approval, deployment is taking a lot of time. Why?A9. Deployment may take around 15 to 20 minutes, depending on the theme file size. This is because the app needs to create the theme bundle file and then upload it to BigCommerce.</p> <p>Q10. When I add GitHub users via the settings panel in the app, What does this exactly do? I already have the dev team added to the main repo in GitHub so does this also need to be done?A10: When you install Staging Pro in your tenant, it creates a separate repository and separate branches; does not use your existing Git repository. When you add Git users in the \u2018Connect GitHub\u2019 tab, it gets associated with the separate repository created for Staging Pro.</p> <p>Q11. Typically we use Dev branch where the developer first pushes, in the Staging Pro world should we consider staging-ENV to be our dev?A11: You can setup the environments, dependent on your company code flow process; Production and Staging if preferred. In this case, its ideal for codes to be committed and tested in staging before being moved to production.</p> <p>Q12. We have some custom build actions, is there a way to run these via you or my flow should remain: PR merge [Develop] \u2192 Jenkins runs \u2192 Merge to staging-env, if pass.A12: Sure, as long as you make the code commit to the correct branch, it will show up in the History &amp; Rollback &gt; Code Deployment tab.</p> <p>Q13. How do you then like to promote code changes from staging \u2192 Integration and Production? Still use merges in GitHub to the named branches or via the UI?A13: The flow that is mostly used is Integration \u2192 Staging \u2192 Production. The reverse flow will also work, as long as there is no code conflict.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"vortex-apps/stagingpro-bigcommerce/stagingpro-github-account-setup/#video-guide","title":"Video guide:","text":"<p>Important</p> <p>GitHub Actions and workflow notifications must be reviewed and fixed by your development team.

If this is your first time using Microsoft Teams, there are three easy steps to follow when setting up a new team. You can find more detailed information on the Microsoft website by clicking here.</p> <p>Step 1: Open Microsoft Teams.

Click \u201cNext\u201d when you are ready.</p> <p></p> <p>Step 4: Finally, we need to add team members. Start by typing the first few letters of a team member\u2019s name, and Teams should display the desired user. Alternatively, you can enter a team member\u2019s email address, and if this does not exist in teams, they will be allowed to join this team as a \u201cguest.\u201d</p> <p></p> <p>The image below shows that your team creation has been successful.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"vortex-apps/stagingpro-bigcommerce/stagingpro-setup-teams/#creating-a-new-teams-channel","title":"Creating a new Teams channel","text":"<p>If you have followed the steps in the previous section, you would now have successfully set up a Team, so next, we need to take a look at creating a channel.

The migration only reads data from your source store and creates copies in the destination store. Your source products remain exactly as they are.</p>How long does a migration take?<p>Migration time depends on your product complexity and catalog size:</p><p>Product Type</p><p>Approximate Time</p><p>Simple product (no variants)</p><p>5-15 seconds</p><p>Product with variants</p><p>15-30 seconds</p><p>Complex product (modifiers, custom fields, reviews)</p><p>30-60 seconds</p><p>Product with locale data</p><p>1-2 minutes</p><p>For bulk migrations:</p><p>Catalog Size</p><p>Approximate Time</p><p>10 products</p><p>5-15 minutes</p><p>100 products</p><p>30-60 minutes</p><p>500 products</p><p>2-4 hours</p><p>1,000+ products</p><p>Several hours</p><p>Note: Products with many images or variants take longer.</p>Can I migrate multiple times?<p>Yes! The platform uses duplicate detection\u2014if a product already exists in the destination (matched by name or SKU), it's updated rather than duplicated. This means you can safely run migrations multiple times without creating duplicate products.</p>What if my migration fails partway through?<ul><li><p>Already-migrated products remain in the destination store</p></li><li><p>The failed product can be retried individually</p></li><li><p>Detailed error information helps identify the issue</p></li><li><p>If updating an existing product, you can trigger a rollback to restore the original data</p></li></ul>Can I rollback a migration?<p>Yes, for products that were updated (not newly created): - A backup is created before any changes - You can restore the product to its pre-migration state - Rollback restores: product base, options, variants, modifiers, custom fields, bulk pricing, and videos - Images are NOT rolled back (they're only added, never deleted)</p>What happens to existing product data when updating?<p>When a product already exists in the destination store (matched by name or SKU), the migration operates in UPDATE mode. This involves a complete cleanup of existing components before recreating them from the source.</p>Why does the platform delete existing components?<p>This ensures: - Clean slate: No orphaned or duplicate data - Accurate transfer: Source becomes single source of truth - Correct mappings: New IDs are properly linked (options to variants, modifiers to complex rules) - No conflicts: Prevents ID mismatches between old and new data</p>What gets deleted in UPDATE mode?<p>Component</p><p>What Happens</p><p>Images</p><p>ALL existing images deleted, then source images uploaded</p><p>Options</p><p>ALL options deleted (variants auto-delete with them)</p><p>Variants</p><p>Deleted when options are removed, then recreated</p><p>Modifiers</p><p>ALL modifiers deleted, then recreated from source</p><p>Custom Fields</p><p>ALL custom fields deleted, then recreated</p><p>Bulk Pricing Rules</p><p>ALL rules deleted, then recreated</p><p>Videos</p><p>ALL videos deleted, then recreated</p>What about complex rules during cleanup?<p>Complex rules are handled intelligently: - Matching rules: If a rule in destination matches source, it's preserved - Auto-generated rules: Single-condition rules (auto-created by BigCommerce) are cleaned up - Non-matching rules: Created fresh from source</p>Is my data backed up before deletion?<p>Yes! Before any deletion occurs: 1. Complete backup is created 2. Includes: product base, options, variants, modifiers, custom fields, bulk pricing, videos 3. Backup retained for rollback capability</p>Can I prevent the cleanup?<p>No. The cleanup is essential for accurate migration. However: - Backup protects you: Rollback available if needed - CREATE mode: If product doesn't exist, no cleanup needed - Test first: Migrate a sample product to verify results</p>What if I only want to update some fields?<p>Currently, migration is all-or-nothing for components. If you need selective updates: 1. Export the product data you want to preserve 2. Run the migration 3. Manually restore specific fields if needed</p><p>Tip: For partial updates, consider using BigCommerce's native import/export tools instead.</p>Will my product images transfer?<p>Yes. Product images are downloaded from your source store and re-uploaded to the destination store. This ensures: - Images are properly hosted in your new store - All image URLs work correctly - Alt text and display order are preserved</p>How is inventory handled?<p>Inventory levels are transferred directly: - Product-level inventory for simple products - Variant-level inventory for products with options - Inventory warning levels are preserved - Inventory tracking settings (none, product, variant) are maintained</p>What about products in multiple categories?<p>Product category assignments are fully preserved: - All category assignments transfer - Category hierarchy is recreated in the destination - If a category doesn't exist, it's created with the full parent path</p><p>Example:</p><pre><code>Product in: Electronics &gt; Computers &gt; Laptops\nAll three categories created if needed, product assigned to \"Laptops\"\n</code></pre>Are product metafields migrated?<p>Yes, both custom fields and metafields are migrated:</p><p>Custom Fields (displayed on storefront): - Field names and values preserved - Display order maintained</p><p>Metafields (key-value metadata): - Product metafields fully migrated - Variant metafields migrated to corresponding variants - Category metafields migrated when categories are created - Namespace and permission settings preserved</p><p>Note: App-specific metafields may require the same app installed in destination to be fully functional.</p>What happens to SEO data?<p>All SEO data transfers directly to help preserve your search engine rankings: - Page title - Meta description - Search keywords - Custom URL path</p>How are option values mapped?<p>When options are created in the destination store, BigCommerce assigns new IDs. The migration platform:</p><ol><li><p>Creates options in the destination (e.g., \"Size\" with values Small, Medium, Large)</p></li><li><p>Records the mapping: Source ID \u2192 Destination ID</p></li><li><p>Uses this mapping when creating variants</p></li></ol><p>This ensures variants are correctly linked to their options.</p>What if a variant's SKU already exists?<p>If you're creating a new product: - All variants are created with their original SKUs - If a SKU conflict exists with another product, the variant creation may fail</p><p>If you're updating an existing product: - Old variants are deleted first - New variants are created with source SKUs</p>Are variant images preserved?<p>Yes. Each variant can have its own image: - Variant-specific images are migrated - Images are linked to the correct variant after migration - Main product images are also preserved</p>What about option display types?<p>All option types are preserved:</p><p>Type</p><p>Migrated</p><p>Notes</p><p>Dropdown</p><p>Yes</p><p>Standard dropdown menu</p><p>Radio Buttons</p><p>Yes</p><p>Radio button selection</p><p>Rectangles</p><p>Yes</p><p>Rectangle/button selector</p><p>Swatch</p><p>Yes</p><p>Color swatches with hex codes</p><p>Product List</p><p>Yes</p><p>Product selection options</p>Is pricing data preserved exactly?<p>Yes, all pricing fields transfer exactly as configured: - Base price - Sale price - Cost price (your cost, hidden from customers) - Retail price (MSRP) - Variant-specific pricing overrides</p>How does bulk pricing work after migration?<p>Bulk pricing rules transfer completely: - All quantity tiers preserved - Discount types (percent off, fixed amount, set price) maintained - Rules apply immediately in the destination store</p><p>Example:</p><pre><code>Buy 10-24: 10% off\nBuy 25-49: 15% off\nBuy 50+: 20% off\n</code></pre><p>All three rules migrate and work immediately.</p>What about inventory levels?<p>Inventory is copied at the time of migration: - Current stock levels transfer - Inventory warning thresholds transfer - Tracking settings (none, product, variant) preserved</p><p>Note: Inventory is a snapshot\u2014changes in the source store after migration won't automatically sync.</p>Are product modifiers migrated?<p>Yes, all modifier types are fully supported:</p><p>Modifier Type</p><p>Migrated</p><p>Notes</p><p>Text Field</p><p>Yes</p><p>Single-line text input</p><p>Multi-Line Text</p><p>Yes</p><p>Text area</p><p>Numbers Only</p><p>Yes</p><p>Numeric input</p><p>Checkbox</p><p>Yes</p><p>Yes/no option</p><p>Date Field</p><p>Yes</p><p>Date picker</p><p>File Upload</p><p>Yes</p><p>Customer file uploads</p><p>Dropdown</p><p>Yes</p><p>Selection menu</p><p>Radio Buttons</p><p>Yes</p><p>Radio selection</p><p>Rectangles</p><p>Yes</p><p>Button selection</p><p>Swatch</p><p>Yes</p><p>Color selection</p><p>Product List</p><p>Yes</p><p>Product selection</p>Do modifier price adjustments work?<p>Yes. Price and weight adjustments on modifier values transfer exactly: - Checkbox that adds $10 \u2192 Works in destination - Dropdown with different prices per option \u2192 All prices preserved</p>What about custom fields?<p>All custom fields migrate: - Field names preserved - Field values preserved - Display order maintained</p><p>Example:</p><pre><code>Material: 100% Cotton\nCare: Machine wash cold\nMade In: USA\n</code></pre><p>All three fields appear on the destination product.</p>What are complex rules?<p>Complex rules are conditional logic rules that trigger actions based on modifier selections. They can: - Adjust price when certain modifier combinations are selected - Adjust weight for shipping calculations - Disable purchasing for certain combinations - Display different images based on selections</p>Are complex rules migrated?<p>Yes! Complex rules are fully migrated with: - All conditions (modifier + value combinations) - Price adjusters (percent, fixed amount, or absolute) - Weight adjusters - Purchasing disabled flags and messages - Enabled/stop flags</p>How are modifier IDs handled in complex rules?<p>The platform automatically maps modifier IDs: 1. Modifiers are created first in destination 2. Source-to-destination ID mapping is captured 3. Complex rules are updated with new modifier IDs 4. Modifier value IDs are also mapped correctly</p>What if a complex rule references a modifier that wasn't migrated?<p>If a modifier ID in a rule can't be mapped: - A warning is logged - The rule may not function correctly - Check that all modifiers were successfully migrated</p>Do complex rules work immediately after migration?<p>Yes. Once migration completes: - Rules are active in destination - Price/weight adjustments apply on product pages - Purchasing restrictions are enforced</p>What about auto-generated complex rules?<p>BigCommerce auto-generates simple complex rules for modifiers with price adjustments. During migration: - Matching auto-generated rules: Preserved (not duplicated) - Redundant auto-generated rules: Cleaned up to avoid conflicts - Custom multi-condition rules: Created fresh from source</p>Can I test complex rules after migration?<p>Yes! To verify complex rules work correctly: 1. Go to product page in destination store 2. Select modifier combinations that should trigger rules 3. Verify price/weight changes in cart 4. Test purchasing restrictions if applicable</p>What's the difference between custom fields and metafields?<p>Feature</p><p>Custom Fields</p><p>Metafields</p><p>Display</p><p>Shown on storefront</p><p>Hidden by default</p><p>Structure</p><p>Name + Value</p><p>Namespace + Key + Value</p><p>Purpose</p><p>Customer-facing info</p><p>App/integration data</p><p>Visibility</p><p>Always visible</p><p>Controlled by permission</p>Are all metafield types supported?<p>Yes, all metafield value types are supported: - String - Integer - Decimal - Date/DateTime - JSON - URL</p>What about metafield permissions?<p>Permission settings are preserved:</p><p>Permission</p><p>Behavior</p><p>app_only</p><p>Only visible to creating app</p><p>read</p><p>Visible via API</p><p>write</p><p>Modifiable via API</p><p>readandsf_access</p><p>Visible on storefront</p>Are variant metafields migrated?<p>Yes. Variant metafields are: 1. Fetched from source variants 2. Mapped to corresponding destination variants (via SKU/option matching) 3. Created on the new variants</p>What about category metafields?<p>When a category is created during migration, its metafields are also migrated: - Existing category metafields in destination are replaced - Source metafields are created on destination category</p>Are product reviews migrated?<p>Yes, customer reviews are fully migrated: - Review title and content - Star rating (1-5) - Reviewer name and email - Original review date - Review status (approved, pending, disapproved)</p>Do review ratings calculate correctly?<p>Yes. After migration: - All reviews are attached to the destination product - Average rating is calculated from migrated reviews - Review count reflects total migrated reviews</p>Can I migrate reviews selectively?<p>Reviews are migrated as part of the product. If you migrate a product, its reviews come along. You cannot currently migrate only reviews without the product.</p>Are multi-language products supported?<p>Yes! The platform migrates locale-specific data across 10 categories:</p><ol><li><p>Basic Information - Translated name and description</p></li><li><p>SEO - Locale-specific page title and meta description</p></li><li><p>URL - Custom URL path per locale</p></li><li><p>Options - Translated option names and values</p></li><li><p>Modifiers - Translated modifier names and values</p></li><li><p>Custom Fields - Translated field names and values</p></li><li><p>Images - Locale-specific alt text and visibility</p></li><li><p>Pre-Order - Translated pre-order messages</p></li><li><p>Storefront - Warranty, availability, search keywords</p></li><li><p>Channel Overrides - Featured status per channel</p></li></ol>What locale data gets migrated?<p>For each locale configured in your source store: - All text content that has locale-specific overrides - Locale-specific URL paths for SEO - Option and modifier label translations - Image alt text translations</p>Do I need to set up locales in the destination first?<p>Locale configuration should be set up in your destination store's settings.

The migration only reads data from your source store and creates copies in the destination store. Your source products remain exactly as they are.</p> How long does a migration take? <p>Migration time depends on your product complexity and catalog size:</p> <p>Product Type</p><p>Approximate Time</p><p>Simple product (no variants)</p><p>5-15 seconds</p><p>Product with variants</p><p>15-30 seconds</p><p>Complex product (modifiers, custom fields, reviews)</p><p>30-60 seconds</p><p>Product with locale data</p><p>1-2 minutes</p> <p>For bulk migrations:</p> <p>Catalog Size</p><p>Approximate Time</p><p>10 products</p><p>5-15 minutes</p><p>100 products</p><p>30-60 minutes</p><p>500 products</p><p>2-4 hours</p><p>1,000+ products</p><p>Several hours</p> <p>Note: Products with many images or variants take longer.</p> Can I migrate multiple times? <p>Yes! The platform uses duplicate detection\u2014if a product already exists in the destination (matched by name or SKU), it's updated rather than duplicated. This means you can safely run migrations multiple times without creating duplicate products.</p> What if my migration fails partway through? <ul><li><p>Already-migrated products remain in the destination store</p></li><li><p>The failed product can be retried individually</p></li><li><p>Detailed error information helps identify the issue</p></li><li><p>If updating an existing product, you can trigger a rollback to restore the original data</p></li></ul> Can I rollback a migration? <p>Yes, for products that were updated (not newly created): - A backup is created before any changes - You can restore the product to its pre-migration state - Rollback restores: product base, options, variants, modifiers, custom fields, bulk pricing, and videos - Images are NOT rolled back (they're only added, never deleted)</p> Component Cleanup (UPDATE Mode) What happens to existing product data when updating? <p>When a product already exists in the destination store (matched by name or SKU), the migration operates in UPDATE mode. This involves a complete cleanup of existing components before recreating them from the source.</p> Why does the platform delete existing components? <p>This ensures: - Clean slate: No orphaned or duplicate data - Accurate transfer: Source becomes single source of truth - Correct mappings: New IDs are properly linked (options to variants, modifiers to complex rules) - No conflicts: Prevents ID mismatches between old and new data</p> What gets deleted in UPDATE mode? <p>Component</p><p>What Happens</p><p>Images</p><p>ALL existing images deleted, then source images uploaded</p><p>Options</p><p>ALL options deleted (variants auto-delete with them)</p><p>Variants</p><p>Deleted when options are removed, then recreated</p><p>Modifiers</p><p>ALL modifiers deleted, then recreated from source</p><p>Custom Fields</p><p>ALL custom fields deleted, then recreated</p><p>Bulk Pricing Rules</p><p>ALL rules deleted, then recreated</p><p>Videos</p><p>ALL videos deleted, then recreated</p> What about complex rules during cleanup? <p>Complex rules are handled intelligently: - Matching rules: If a rule in destination matches source, it's preserved - Auto-generated rules: Single-condition rules (auto-created by BigCommerce) are cleaned up - Non-matching rules: Created fresh from source</p> Is my data backed up before deletion? <p>Yes! Before any deletion occurs: 1. Complete backup is created 2. Includes: product base, options, variants, modifiers, custom fields, bulk pricing, videos 3. Backup retained for rollback capability</p> Can I prevent the cleanup? <p>No. The cleanup is essential for accurate migration. However: - Backup protects you: Rollback available if needed - CREATE mode: If product doesn't exist, no cleanup needed - Test first: Migrate a sample product to verify results</p> What if I only want to update some fields? <p>Currently, migration is all-or-nothing for components. If you need selective updates: 1. Export the product data you want to preserve 2. Run the migration 3. Manually restore specific fields if needed</p> <p>Tip: For partial updates, consider using BigCommerce's native import/export tools instead.</p> Products &amp; Catalog Will my product images transfer? <p>Yes. Product images are downloaded from your source store and re-uploaded to the destination store. This ensures: - Images are properly hosted in your new store - All image URLs work correctly - Alt text and display order are preserved</p> How is inventory handled? <p>Inventory levels are transferred directly: - Product-level inventory for simple products - Variant-level inventory for products with options - Inventory warning levels are preserved - Inventory tracking settings (none, product, variant) are maintained</p> What about products in multiple categories? <p>Product category assignments are fully preserved: - All category assignments transfer - Category hierarchy is recreated in the destination - If a category doesn't exist, it's created with the full parent path</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre><code>Product in: Electronics &gt; Computers &gt; Laptops\nAll three categories created if needed, product assigned to \"Laptops\"\n</code></pre> Are product metafields migrated? <p>Yes, both custom fields and metafields are migrated:</p> <p>Custom Fields (displayed on storefront): - Field names and values preserved - Display order maintained</p> <p>Metafields (key-value metadata): - Product metafields fully migrated - Variant metafields migrated to corresponding variants - Category metafields migrated when categories are created - Namespace and permission settings preserved</p> <p>Note: App-specific metafields may require the same app installed in destination to be fully functional.</p> What happens to SEO data? <p>All SEO data transfers directly to help preserve your search engine rankings: - Page title - Meta description - Search keywords - Custom URL path</p> Variants &amp; Options How are option values mapped? <p>When options are created in the destination store, BigCommerce assigns new IDs. The migration platform:</p> <ol><li><p>Creates options in the destination (e.g., \"Size\" with values Small, Medium, Large)</p></li><li><p>Records the mapping: Source ID \u2192 Destination ID</p></li><li><p>Uses this mapping when creating variants</p></li></ol> <p>This ensures variants are correctly linked to their options.</p> What if a variant's SKU already exists? <p>If you're creating a new product: - All variants are created with their original SKUs - If a SKU conflict exists with another product, the variant creation may fail</p> <p>If you're updating an existing product: - Old variants are deleted first - New variants are created with source SKUs</p> Are variant images preserved? <p>Yes. Each variant can have its own image: - Variant-specific images are migrated - Images are linked to the correct variant after migration - Main product images are also preserved</p> What about option display types? <p>All option types are preserved:</p> <p>Type</p><p>Migrated</p><p>Notes</p><p>Dropdown</p><p>Yes</p><p>Standard dropdown menu</p><p>Radio Buttons</p><p>Yes</p><p>Radio button selection</p><p>Rectangles</p><p>Yes</p><p>Rectangle/button selector</p><p>Swatch</p><p>Yes</p><p>Color swatches with hex codes</p><p>Product List</p><p>Yes</p><p>Product selection options</p> Pricing &amp; Inventory Is pricing data preserved exactly? <p>Yes, all pricing fields transfer exactly as configured: - Base price - Sale price - Cost price (your cost, hidden from customers) - Retail price (MSRP) - Variant-specific pricing overrides</p> How does bulk pricing work after migration? <p>Bulk pricing rules transfer completely: - All quantity tiers preserved - Discount types (percent off, fixed amount, set price) maintained - Rules apply immediately in the destination store</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre><code>Buy 10-24: 10% off\nBuy 25-49: 15% off\nBuy 50+: 20% off\n</code></pre> <p>All three rules migrate and work immediately.</p> What about inventory levels? <p>Inventory is copied at the time of migration: - Current stock levels transfer - Inventory warning thresholds transfer - Tracking settings (none, product, variant) preserved</p> <p>Note: Inventory is a snapshot\u2014changes in the source store after migration won't automatically sync.</p> Modifiers &amp; Custom Fields Are product modifiers migrated? <p>Yes, all modifier types are fully supported:</p> <p>Modifier Type</p><p>Migrated</p><p>Notes</p><p>Text Field</p><p>Yes</p><p>Single-line text input</p><p>Multi-Line Text</p><p>Yes</p><p>Text area</p><p>Numbers Only</p><p>Yes</p><p>Numeric input</p><p>Checkbox</p><p>Yes</p><p>Yes/no option</p><p>Date Field</p><p>Yes</p><p>Date picker</p><p>File Upload</p><p>Yes</p><p>Customer file uploads</p><p>Dropdown</p><p>Yes</p><p>Selection menu</p><p>Radio Buttons</p><p>Yes</p><p>Radio selection</p><p>Rectangles</p><p>Yes</p><p>Button selection</p><p>Swatch</p><p>Yes</p><p>Color selection</p><p>Product List</p><p>Yes</p><p>Product selection</p> Do modifier price adjustments work? <p>Yes. Price and weight adjustments on modifier values transfer exactly: - Checkbox that adds $10 \u2192 Works in destination - Dropdown with different prices per option \u2192 All prices preserved</p> What about custom fields? <p>All custom fields migrate: - Field names preserved - Field values preserved - Display order maintained</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre><code>Material: 100% Cotton\nCare: Machine wash cold\nMade In: USA\n</code></pre> <p>All three fields appear on the destination product.</p> Complex Rules What are complex rules? <p>Complex rules are conditional logic rules that trigger actions based on modifier selections. They can: - Adjust price when certain modifier combinations are selected - Adjust weight for shipping calculations - Disable purchasing for certain combinations - Display different images based on selections</p> Are complex rules migrated? <p>Yes! Complex rules are fully migrated with: - All conditions (modifier + value combinations) - Price adjusters (percent, fixed amount, or absolute) - Weight adjusters - Purchasing disabled flags and messages - Enabled/stop flags</p> How are modifier IDs handled in complex rules? <p>The platform automatically maps modifier IDs: 1. Modifiers are created first in destination 2. Source-to-destination ID mapping is captured 3. Complex rules are updated with new modifier IDs 4. Modifier value IDs are also mapped correctly</p> What if a complex rule references a modifier that wasn't migrated? <p>If a modifier ID in a rule can't be mapped: - A warning is logged - The rule may not function correctly - Check that all modifiers were successfully migrated</p> Do complex rules work immediately after migration? <p>Yes. Once migration completes: - Rules are active in destination - Price/weight adjustments apply on product pages - Purchasing restrictions are enforced</p> What about auto-generated complex rules? <p>BigCommerce auto-generates simple complex rules for modifiers with price adjustments. During migration: - Matching auto-generated rules: Preserved (not duplicated) - Redundant auto-generated rules: Cleaned up to avoid conflicts - Custom multi-condition rules: Created fresh from source</p> Can I test complex rules after migration? <p>Yes! To verify complex rules work correctly: 1. Go to product page in destination store 2. Select modifier combinations that should trigger rules 3. Verify price/weight changes in cart 4. Test purchasing restrictions if applicable</p> Metafields What's the difference between custom fields and metafields? <p>Feature</p><p>Custom Fields</p><p>Metafields</p><p>Display</p><p>Shown on storefront</p><p>Hidden by default</p><p>Structure</p><p>Name + Value</p><p>Namespace + Key + Value</p><p>Purpose</p><p>Customer-facing info</p><p>App/integration data</p><p>Visibility</p><p>Always visible</p><p>Controlled by permission</p> Are all metafield types supported? <p>Yes, all metafield value types are supported: - String - Integer - Decimal - Date/DateTime - JSON - URL</p> What about metafield permissions? <p>Permission settings are preserved:</p> <p>Permission</p><p>Behavior</p><p>app_only</p><p>Only visible to creating app</p><p>read</p><p>Visible via API</p><p>write</p><p>Modifiable via API</p><p>readandsf_access</p><p>Visible on storefront</p> Are variant metafields migrated? <p>Yes. Variant metafields are: 1. Fetched from source variants 2. Mapped to corresponding destination variants (via SKU/option matching) 3. Created on the new variants</p> What about category metafields? <p>When a category is created during migration, its metafields are also migrated: - Existing category metafields in destination are replaced - Source metafields are created on destination category</p> Reviews Are product reviews migrated? <p>Yes, customer reviews are fully migrated: - Review title and content - Star rating (1-5) - Reviewer name and email - Original review date - Review status (approved, pending, disapproved)</p> Do review ratings calculate correctly? <p>Yes. After migration: - All reviews are attached to the destination product - Average rating is calculated from migrated reviews - Review count reflects total migrated reviews</p> Can I migrate reviews selectively? <p>Reviews are migrated as part of the product. If you migrate a product, its reviews come along. You cannot currently migrate only reviews without the product.</p> Localization (Multi-Language) Are multi-language products supported? <p>Yes! The platform migrates locale-specific data across 10 categories:</p> <ol><li><p>Basic Information - Translated name and description</p></li><li><p>SEO - Locale-specific page title and meta description</p></li><li><p>URL - Custom URL path per locale</p></li><li><p>Options - Translated option names and values</p></li><li><p>Modifiers - Translated modifier names and values</p></li><li><p>Custom Fields - Translated field names and values</p></li><li><p>Images - Locale-specific alt text and visibility</p></li><li><p>Pre-Order - Translated pre-order messages</p></li><li><p>Storefront - Warranty, availability, search keywords</p></li><li><p>Channel Overrides - Featured status per channel</p></li></ol> What locale data gets migrated? <p>For each locale configured in your source store: - All text content that has locale-specific overrides - Locale-specific URL paths for SEO - Option and modifier label translations - Image alt text translations</p> Do I need to set up locales in the destination first? <p>Locale configuration should be set up in your destination store's settings. The migration transfers the locale-specific content, but your store must be configured to display those locales.</p> Brands &amp; Categories How are brands handled? <p>Brands are matched by name: 1. Source product has brand \"AudioTech\" 2. Platform searches destination for \"AudioTech\" 3. If found: Uses existing brand 4. If not found: Creates new brand</p> What about category hierarchy? <p>Categories are recreated with full hierarchy:</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre><code>Source category path: Electronics &gt; Audio &gt; Headphones\n\nMigration creates (if needed):\n1. \"Electronics\" (top level)\n2. \"Audio\" (child of Electronics)\n3. \"Headphones\" (child of Audio)\n\nProduct assigned to \"Headphones\"\n</code></pre> Are category descriptions migrated? <p>When a category is created, only the essential information is migrated: - Category name - Parent relationship</p> <p>Category descriptions, images, and SEO data are not part of product migration. For full category migration, a separate process would be needed.</p> Widget Templates &amp; Custom Templates What are widget templates? <p>Widget templates control how product page widgets appear. If your source product uses custom widgets, the template definitions are migrated to ensure the destination product displays correctly.</p> What about custom page templates? <p>If your source product uses a custom page template (e.g., <code>product-special.html</code>), the association is recreated in the destination.</p> <p>Important: The template file itself must exist in your destination theme. Only the association is migrated, not the template file.</p> Same-Store Channel Migration (Multi-Storefront) What happens when source and destination stores are the same? <p>When you migrate between channels in the same store, the platform automatically uses a simplified channel migration workflow. This is detected when: - Source store ID = Destination store ID - Source channel ID \u2260 Destination channel ID</p> <p>In this mode, only channel-specific content is migrated because the product already exists.</p> Why aren't product components migrated in channel migration? <p>In same-store channel migration: - The product already exists in the store - Options, variants, modifiers, etc. are store-level data, not channel-specific - Only channel-specific data needs to be set up for the new channel</p> <p>What IS migrated: - Category assignments (to destination channel's tree) - Channel assignment (makes product visible) - Widget templates - Custom template associations - Locale data for the destination channel</p> <p>What is NOT migrated: - Product base data (already exists) - Options and variants (store-level) - Modifiers and complex rules (store-level) - Images and videos (store-level) - Custom fields, bulk pricing, reviews (store-level)</p> Can I rollback a channel migration? <p>No, channel migration does not include backup/rollback because: - Nothing is deleted: Original product data unchanged - Non-destructive: Only adds visibility to new channel - Reversible manually: Remove channel assignment via BigCommerce admin</p> <p>To \"undo\" a channel migration: 1. Go to BigCommerce admin 2. Edit the product 3.

Proper permission settings</p> <p>If the creating app isn't installed, metafields exist but may not function as expected.</p> Best Practices Before Migration <ol><li><p>Verify source data: Ensure products have complete data</p></li><li><p>Check images: Confirm all image URLs are accessible</p></li><li><p>Review inventory: Know your current stock levels</p></li><li><p>Document custom templates: Note which templates your products use</p></li></ol> During Migration <ol><li><p>Start small: Test with a few products first</p></li><li><p>Monitor progress: Check migration status regularly</p></li><li><p>Review results: Verify migrated products look correct</p></li></ol> After Migration <ol><li><p>Spot check products: Review several products in detail</p></li><li><p>Test purchasing: Add products to cart, check pricing</p></li><li><p>Verify images: Confirm all images display correctly</p></li><li><p>Check variants: Test option selection and variant switching</p></li><li><p>Review SEO: Confirm page titles and meta descriptions</p></li></ol> Still Have Questions? <p>When contacting support, please provide: - Source and destination store identifiers - Product IDs you're trying to migrate - Any error messages you've encountered - Screenshots if applicable</p> <p>We're here to help ensure a smooth migration!</p> <p>Click here \u2192 Understanding the StagingPro App pages to understand other pages of the app.</p> <p>To view our Onboarding steps, please access the following article \u2192 StagingPro Onboarding</p> <p>\u2190 Back to Help Center</p>"},{"location":"vortex-apps/stagingpro-bigcommerce/selective-content-migration/selective-product-migration/field-mapping/","title":"Field Mapping Reference","text":"<p>This document provides detailed information about how each product field is migrated from your source BigCommerce store to your destination store.</p> Product Base Information <p>The core product data that defines your product listing.</p> Basic Product Fields <p>Source Field</p><p>Destination</p><p>Migration Behavior</p><p>Name</p><p>Name</p><p>Direct transfer</p><p>Description</p><p>Description</p><p>Full HTML preserved</p><p>SKU</p><p>SKU</p><p>Direct transfer (used for duplicate check)</p><p>Type</p><p>Type</p><p>physical, digital, or downloadable</p><p>Weight</p><p>Weight</p><p>Direct transfer</p><p>Width</p><p>Width</p><p>Direct transfer</p><p>Height</p><p>Height</p><p>Direct transfer</p><p>Depth</p><p>Depth</p><p>Direct transfer</p><p>Condition</p><p>Condition</p><p>New, Used, or Refurbished</p><p>Is Visible</p><p>Is Visible</p><p>Storefront visibility</p><p>Is Featured</p><p>Is Featured</p><p>Featured product flag</p> Pricing Fields <p>Source Field</p><p>Destination</p><p>Migration Behavior</p><p>Price</p><p>Price</p><p>Base price - direct transfer</p><p>Cost Price</p><p>Cost Price</p><p>Your cost (not shown to customers)</p><p>Retail Price</p><p>Retail Price</p><p>Suggested retail/MSRP</p><p>Sale Price</p><p>Sale Price</p><p>Promotional price</p><p>Tax Class ID</p><p>Tax Class ID</p><p>Tax classification</p> <p>Note: All pricing is transferred exactly as-is.
