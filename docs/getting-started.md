# Getting Started with Vortex IQ

**Vortex IQ is the world's first AI Operating System (AI OS) built exclusively for eCommerce. In a single workspace, it unifies your store data, monitors revenue in real time, and deploys a digital workforce of AI agents — all without requiring any technical setup. You can be fully operational in under five minutes.**

## Why Merchants Are Making the Switch

The average eCommerce operator today juggles a patchwork of separate tools: one for SEO, another for inventory, a third for analytics, and yet another for staging. The result is data silos, missed signals, and hours lost every week stitching reports together manually.

Vortex IQ was built to replace that fragmentation with a single AI-powered command center. The shift is already well underway: the global AI-enabled eCommerce market is valued at **$9.01 billion in 2025**, projected to grow to **$74.93 billion by 2035** at a 23.59% annual growth rate (Source: [Precedence Research](https://www.precedenceresearch.com/artificial-intelligence-in-e-commerce-market)). Meanwhile, **69% of retailers who have adopted AI report direct, measurable revenue increases**, and **77% of eCommerce professionals now use AI daily** (Source: [EComposer – AI in eCommerce Statistics 2025](https://ecomposer.io/blogs/ecommerce/ai-in-ecommerce-statistics)).

Businesses that connect unified AI platforms — rather than cobbling together point solutions — generate **40% more revenue** than those relying on traditional tools (Source: [EComposer](https://ecomposer.io/blogs/ecommerce/ai-in-ecommerce-statistics)).

Vortex IQ is how you access that advantage from day one.

3. **Connect your store** — Link Shopify, BigCommerce, or Adobe Commerce in one click.
4. **Connect your marketing sources** — Add Google Analytics, Google Ads, or Facebook Ads.
5. **Activate your first Agent** — Hire a Monitoring or Insights agent to begin receiving real-time alerts.

## Step-by-Step: Creating Your Account

### Step 1: Choose Your Account Type

When you first visit Vortex IQ, you will be asked to select your account type before registering.

    <em>Choose this if you manage multiple client accounts.</em>
  </div>
</div>

### Step 2: Sign Up Securely

Vortex IQ offers two ways to create your account — both are passwordless-capable for maximum security:

**Option A: Google SSO (Recommended)**
Click **"Continue with Google"** to use your existing work credentials. This is the fastest sign-up path, and it activates enterprise-grade identity protection automatically.

**Option B: Email & Password**
Enter your professional email and choose a secure password (minimum 8 characters). Your workspace is created immediately — no waiting for approval.

!!! note "Managing Your Password"
    If you ever need to reset or change your password:

    1. Navigate to the Login page.
    2. Enter your registered email address.
    3. Click **"Send Password Reset Link"**.
    4. Check your inbox and click the link to set your new password securely.

### Step 3: Register Your Organisation

After signing in, you will complete your organisation profile. This powers how Vortex IQ labels reports, sends alerts, and communicates with your team.

Fill in your:
- **Organisation name** and website
- **Contact details** (phone, address, city, country)
- **Primary contact** (name + email for the account owner)

<!-- screenshot: Organisation registration form with fields highlighted -->

!!! note "Terms & Trial Activation"
    Accept the Terms of Service to activate your 30-day free trial. Your account is immediately ready — no setup calls or approval queues.

### Step 4: Complete the Onboarding Wizard

Once registered, you are guided through a 4-step wizard that personalises your experience:

1. **Tell us your interests** — Select which areas matter most to you (SEO, monitoring, analytics, automation). This helps Vortex IQ surface the most relevant agents and insights for your store.

2. **Connect your first data source** — Link at least one platform (see [Connecting Data Sources](configuration.md) for full details). This step unlocks your Command Centre and begins real-time data sync.

3. **Review your workspace** — See a summary of your connected sources and selected interests.

4. **Launch your Command Centre** — You're live. Your AI OS is active.

## AI Safety & Guardrails: How Vortex IQ Keeps You in Control

From the moment you sign up, every action in Vortex IQ operates within a strict safety framework called **AI Guardrails**. This is not just a setting — it is the foundation of the platform.

**Human-in-the-Loop by Default:** No AI agent can take a high-risk action (such as publishing a price change, triggering a bulk update, or issuing a refund) without your explicit approval. You remain the decision-maker; the AI surfaces recommendations and waits for your sign-off.

**Role-Based Access:** Your workspace is created with three pre-configured access levels — Administrator, Manager, and User — so every team member works within appropriate boundaries from day one. See [Roles & Permissions](governance/roles-permissions.md) for full details.

**Zero PII Storage:** When you connect your store, Vortex IQ processes insights — it does not store your customers' personal information. Only aggregated, anonymised signals are used to power recommendations.

**Encrypted Credentials:** Every platform connection (Shopify, BigCommerce, Google Analytics, etc.) is secured with OAuth 2.0 authorization and encrypted credential storage. Your API tokens are never exposed or shared.
