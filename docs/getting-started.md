### Step 2: Secure Sign-Up Methods

We prioritize security and ease of access. You do not need to create a password to get started.

* **Option A: Google SSO (Recommended)** Click "Continue with Google" to use your existing work credentials. This is the fastest method.

* **Option B: Email with Magic Link** Enter your professional email address. We do not require a password upfront. Instead, we will send a secure **Magic Link** to your inbox. Click it to verify your identity instantly.

## 2. Managing Your Password

If you choose to use a standard password instead of Google SSO or Magic Links, you can set one up easily.

!!! note "Resetting or Creating a Password"
    If you signed up via email and need to create a new password or reset an old one:

    1. Navigate to the Login page.
    2. Enter your registered email address in the box.
    3. Click the **"Send Password Reset Link"** button.
    4. Check your inbox and click the link to securely set your password.
