# Getting Started with Vortex IQ

**Vortex IQ is the world's first AI Agentic Operating System (AI OS) built exclusively for eCommerce. In a single workspace, it unifies your store data, monitors revenue in real time, and deploys a digital workforce of AI agents — all without requiring any technical setup. You can be fully operational in under five minutes.**

## Why an "Operating System" Replaces Your Disjointed Tools

The modern eCommerce stack is a patchwork of disconnected tools — one for SEO, another for inventory, a third for analytics, and a fourth for advertising. The result is data silos, missed signals, and hours lost each week manually reconciling reports across platforms that were never built to work together.

Vortex IQ was built to replace that fragmentation with a single, intelligent Command Centre. The shift is already happening at scale: **77% of eCommerce professionals now use AI daily**, and **92% of companies investing in AI eventually see positive ROI**, with an average payback period of just 9 months (Source: [EComposer — AI in eCommerce Statistics 2025](https://ecomposer.io/blogs/ecommerce/ai-in-ecommerce-statistics); [Envive.ai — AI Personalization Statistics 2026](https://www.envive.ai/post/ai-personalization-in-ecommerce-lift-statistics)). AI-powered recommendations alone can **triple revenue** and more than double conversion rates compared to unaided browsing — and businesses that excel at AI-driven personalisation generate **40% more revenue** than those using fragmented tools (Source: McKinsey & Company).

Vortex IQ is how you access that advantage — from day one, without a single line of code.

## The "First 5 Minutes" Checklist

Onboarding is designed to require zero technical knowledge and zero code. Follow these steps to activate your AI Command Centre:

1. **Create your workspace** — Sign up with Google, use a Magic Link, or register with email and password.
2. **Choose your account type** — Merchant (single brand) or Partner (agency managing multiple clients).
3. **Tell us your interests** — Select the areas that matter most: SEO, monitoring, analytics, or automation.
4. **Connect your store** — Link Shopify, BigCommerce, or Adobe Commerce in one click.
5. **Activate your first Agent** — Hire a Monitoring or Insights agent to begin receiving real-time alerts.

!!! tip "Your 30-Day Free Trial Starts on Day One"
    Every new account includes a full-featured 30-day trial — no credit card required upfront. All capabilities, including Agent Hub and Nerve Centre alerting, are available immediately from your first login.

## Step-by-Step: Creating Your Account

### Step 1: Choose Your Account Type

When you first visit Vortex IQ, you will be asked to select your account type. This choice configures your workspace and determines which multi-client features are available to you.

*The Create Account screen showing the Merchant and Partner account type toggle, the "Sign up with Google" SSO option, registration fields, and the "Get Magic Link" passwordless option — along with three left-panel value propositions: Orchestrate Your Ecosystem, From Insight to Action, and Deploy Specialised Agents.*

| Account Type | Who It's For |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Merchant** | Brand owners, eCommerce managers, and in-house teams managing a single store or brand. |
| **Partner** | Agencies, system integrators, and technology partners managing multiple client accounts from one workspace. |

### Step 2: Sign Up Securely

Vortex IQ provides three sign-up options — all delivering enterprise-grade identity protection from the moment your account is created:

**Option A: Sign up with Google (Recommended)**
Click **"Sign up with Google"** to use your existing work credentials. This is the fastest path, activating automatic identity verification and secure access instantly through Google's enterprise identity infrastructure.

**Option B: Get Magic Link (Passwordless)**
Enter your professional email and click **"Get Magic Link"**. A one-time secure link is sent to your inbox. Click it to sign in — no password is ever set or stored.

**Option C: Email & Password**
Enter your full name, company name, and professional email. Choose a secure password (minimum 8 characters). Your workspace is created immediately — no approval queue, no waiting period.

![Login screen showing Continue with Google, email and password form, Continue with Email, and Send Password Reset Link](<../aios screenshots/login-sign in.png>)

*The Login screen showing all sign-in options: "Continue with Google", email and password form, "Continue with Email", and the "Send Password Reset Link" recovery option.*

!!! note "Password Reset"
    If you ever need to update your password:

    1. Navigate to the **Login** page.
    2. Enter your registered email address.
    3. Click **"Send Password Reset Link"**.
    4. Check your inbox and click the secure link to set your new password.

### Step 3: Register Your Organisation

After signing in for the first time, you will complete your organisation profile. This information powers how Vortex IQ labels your reports, sends team alerts, and personalises your AI agents' communication.

Provide the following:
- **Organisation name** and website URL
- **Contact details** — phone number, address, city, and country
- **Primary account owner** — name and email address

<!-- screenshot: Organisation registration form with all fields displayed, highlighting the "Organisation Name" and "Primary Contact" sections -->

!!! note "Terms & Trial Activation"
    Accepting the Terms of Service activates your 30-day free trial instantly. Your workspace is ready immediately — no setup calls, no approval queues, and no credit card required to start.

### Step 4: Complete the Onboarding Wizard

Once registered, a guided four-step wizard personalises your Vortex IQ experience:

**Step 1 — Tell Us Your Interests**
Select which operational areas matter most: SEO & Content, Revenue Monitoring, Analytics & Reporting, or Automation & Agents. This helps Vortex IQ surface the most relevant agents and insights for your store.

**Step 2 — Connect Your First Data Source**
Link at least one platform to unlock your Command Centre and begin real-time data synchronisation. Supported during onboarding: Shopify, BigCommerce, Google Analytics, and Facebook Ads. (See [Connecting Data Sources](configuration.md) for full setup details.)

**Step 3 — Review Your Workspace**
See a summary of your connected sources, selected interest areas, and the agents ready to activate.

**Step 4 — Launch Your Command Centre**
You are live. Your AI OS is active, your 30-day trial has started, and your first agents are standing by.

!!! tip "Connecting Unlocks Everything"
    Your onboarding is marked complete the moment you connect your first platform. You land directly in your Command Centre, with the Nerve Centre already scanning your store data in real time.

### Step 5: Your Command Centre Is Live

After completing onboarding, you arrive at your personalised Command Centre — the hub of your entire AI Operating System.

## Outcome & Impact: What Happens After You Connect

The first five minutes of Vortex IQ are by design the last time setup ever feels like work. From the moment your store is connected, the platform runs continuously — no manual configuration, no scheduled maintenance.

Merchants who complete onboarding and activate their first agent within the first session consistently see three immediate outcomes:

- **Instant situational awareness** — Your Command Centre begins surfacing KPI cards and trend lines from your connected store data within minutes.
- **Proactive alerts** — The Nerve Centre starts monitoring your site health, inventory status, and ad spend efficiency before you even close your browser tab.
- **First agent action within 24 hours** — Your first AI recommendation or completed task is typically delivered within the first business day.

The long-term impact is equally significant. Businesses that implement unified AI platforms report **15 to 25% revenue increases** within the first 90 days, driven by better personalisation, faster anomaly detection, and more efficient ad targeting (Source: [ReferralCandy — eCommerce Data Integration Guide 2026](https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/the-complete-ecommerce-data-integration-guide-for-2026-connecting-your-systems-for-growth)). And **69% of retailers who implemented AI report direct, measurable revenue increases traceable to that adoption** (Source: [EComposer — AI in eCommerce Statistics 2025](https://ecomposer.io/blogs/ecommerce/ai-in-ecommerce-statistics)).

## AI Safety & Guardrails: How Vortex IQ Keeps You in Control

From your very first login, every action in Vortex IQ operates within a strict safety framework called **AI Guardrails**. This is not a setting you enable — it is the foundational architecture of the platform.

**Human-in-the-Loop by Default:**
No AI agent can take a high-impact action — such as publishing a price change, triggering a bulk content update, or issuing a refund — without your explicit review and approval. The AI surfaces the recommendation, presents its reasoning, and waits for your sign-off. You always remain the decision-maker.

**Role-Based Access from Day One:**
Your workspace is provisioned with three pre-configured access levels during registration. Every team member you invite works within clearly defined boundaries:
- **Administrator** — Full access to all settings, AI configuration, and security controls.
- **Manager** — Can activate and deactivate agents, approve agent actions, and view all dashboards.
- **User (Viewer)** — Can view the Command Centre and reports but cannot interact with agents or approve changes.

**Zero PII Storage:**
When you connect your store, Vortex IQ processes aggregated business signals — it does not store your customers' personally identifiable information (PII). Only anonymised patterns are used to power recommendations, in full compliance with GDPR and CCPA.

**Encrypted Credentials:**
Every platform connection is secured with industry-standard OAuth 2.0 authorisation and encrypted credential storage. Your store access tokens are encrypted before saving and are never displayed in plain text after the initial connection.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I need technical knowledge or developer support to set up Vortex IQ?**
No. The entire onboarding process — from account creation to connecting your first store — is designed for non-technical merchants and operators. There is no code to write, no files to configure, and no developer required at any point.

**Q: What is the difference between "Get Magic Link" and signing up with Google?**
Both are passwordless and highly secure. "Get Magic Link" sends a one-time secure link to your email — click it to sign in with no password required. "Sign up with Google" uses your existing Google Workspace credentials to authenticate instantly. Google sign-in is the fastest option if you already use Google at work.

**Q: Can I connect multiple stores to one account?**
Yes. Partner Accounts are designed to manage multiple client storefronts from a single workspace, each with its own isolated data and agent configuration. Merchant Accounts support a primary store with the ability to add additional platform integrations from Settings at any time.

**Q: What happens to my data if I cancel my subscription?**
Your workspace data is retained for 30 days after cancellation, giving you time to export reports or reconnect if you change your mind. Vortex IQ does not store your customers' personal information at any point during or after your subscription.

**Q: What platforms can I connect during the initial onboarding wizard?**
During onboarding you can connect Shopify, BigCommerce, Google Analytics (GA4), and Facebook Ads. Additional platforms — including Adobe Commerce, Google Ads, Stripe, Slack, and Microsoft Teams — can be added at any time from the **Settings → Connected Sources** page after your workspace is active.
