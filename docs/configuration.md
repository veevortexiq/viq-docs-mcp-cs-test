## 2. Managing Team Members

Collaboration is key to the Vortex IQ experience. You can invite team members to your specific environment and control their access levels.

!!! warning "Permission Required"
    Only users with **Admin** privileges can invite new users. If you do not see the "Invite User" button, please contact your account owner to request access.

### How to Invite a New User:

1. Scroll down to the **Team Members** section.
2. Click the blue **"Invite User"** button.
3. Enter the user's professional email address.
4. Select a Role (e.g., *Admin, Editor, Viewer*).
5. Click **Send Invitation**.

*The user will appear as "Pending" until they accept the invite via email.*

### Revoking Access

If a team member leaves or no longer requires access:

* Find the user in the list.
* Click the **Trash/Delete icon** next to their name.
* Confirm the removal. This will immediately revoke their access to the Nerve Centre and all modules.
