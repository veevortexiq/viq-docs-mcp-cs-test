# Google Ads Performance Agent

## Agent Overview
VIQ is an intelligent assistant specialized in Google Ads analysis and insights for the Vortex IQ platform. Acting as a dedicated business analyst, it translates complex advertising data into clear, actionable business intelligence. 

Instead of overwhelming users with raw data tables, the agent focuses on the "so what?"—explaining trends, identifying patterns, and highlighting significant changes in performance. Its goal is to help users understand their ad investment's impact and provide specific, implementable recommendations to optimize strategy, all delivered in a professional yet approachable conversational style.

## Agent Tools
The agent utilizes a suite of specialized analytical tools to provide comprehensive insights:

*   **Account Structure Analysis**: Reviews the fundamental setup of your ad account, including campaign organization, budget allocation, and ad group structure to ensure a healthy foundation for your ads.
*   **Performance Reporting**: Delivers deep-dive metrics on campaigns, ads, and keywords. It identifies exactly what is driving costs and clicks, helping to pinpoint high-performing and underperforming areas.
*   **Segmentation Insights**: Breaks down performance data into specific categories such as device type (mobile vs. desktop), time of day, and geographic location, revealing hidden opportunities for optimization.
*   **Audience Demographics**: Analyzes the characteristics of the people engaging with your ads, specifically focusing on age groups and gender distributions to refine targeting strategies.
*   **Conversion Tracking**: Focuses on the bottom line by tracking Return on Investment (ROI) and specific conversion actions, showing which parts of your campaigns are generating real business value.

## Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Strategic Budget Optimization
**User Goal:** The user wants to ensure their monthly budget is yielding the best possible returns.

**Agent Action:** The agent uses **Account Structure** and **Performance Reporting** tools to analyze current spend distribution. It identifies that a specific campaign is consuming 40% of the budget but driving only 10% of conversions.

**Outcome:** The agent recommends reallocating budget from the low-performing campaign to a high-ROI campaign, potentially increasing overall conversions without increasing total spend.

### Scenario 2: Demographic Targeting Refinement
**User Goal:** The user is launching a new product line and wants to know who their current best customers are.

**Agent Action:** Using **Audience Demographics** and **Segmentation Insights**, the agent discovers that "Females aged 25-34" on mobile devices have a 20% higher conversion rate than other segments.

**Outcome:** The agent suggests adjusting bid modifiers to aggressively target this specific demographic on mobile devices, maximizing efficiency for the new product launch.

### Scenario 3: Diagnosing Performance Drops
**User Goal:** The user notices a sudden drop in sales and asks, "Why did my performance go down this week?"

**Agent Action:** The agent employs **Performance Reporting** and **Conversion Tracking** tools to compare this week's data against the previous period. It pinpoints that a top-performing keyword has seen a spike in Cost-Per-Click (CPC) due to increased competition.

**Outcome:** The agent explains the specific cause of the drop and recommends refining the ad copy or testing new long-tail keywords to bypass the increased competition.
