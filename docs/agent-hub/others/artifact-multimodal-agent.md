# Artifact Multimodal Agent

## Agent Overview
The Artifact Multimodal Agent is your intelligent assistant for analyzing documents and images. It can access files from the web, understand their content, and provide you with detailed summaries, key points, and answers to your questions. Whether it's a text document, a PDF, or an image, this agent has the tools and vision capabilities to process it.

## Agent Tools
Here's a simple overview of what the agent can do for you:

*   **Download and Save:** Give the agent a link to a file on the internet, and it will download and save it for you to work with.
*   **Load and Analyze:** This lets the agent "see" and understand the files you've saved. It can read text documents and even analyze the contents of images.
*   **List Files:** The agent can show you a list of all the files you've uploaded or saved during your session, so you can easily keep track of them.

## Sub-agents
This agent operates as a single, powerful unit and does not have any sub-agents.
