## Why a Managed Digital Workforce Changes Everything

The shift from isolated automation tools to a coordinated digital workforce is one of the most significant operational advantages available to eCommerce teams today. The AI agents market is projected to exceed **$10.9 billion in 2026**, growing at over 45% per year — and the business case is driven entirely by measurable commercial results (Source: [AI Agent Adoption Statistics by Industry 2026 — Salesmate.io](https://www.salesmate.io/blog/ai-agents-adoption-statistics/)).

Companies deploying AI agent platforms report average returns on investment of **171%**, with U.S. enterprises achieving approximately **192% ROI** — exceeding traditional automation ROI by a factor of three (Source: [Agentic AI Stats 2026: Adoption Rates, ROI & Market Trends — OneReach.ai](https://onereach.ai/blog/agentic-ai-adoption-rates-roi-market-trends/)). **74% of executives report achieving this ROI within the first year** of deployment — making AI agents one of the fastest-returning investments in the modern eCommerce technology stack.

For eCommerce operators specifically, the commercial impact is felt immediately. **76% of retailers are increasing their investment in AI agents over the next 12 months**, focusing on product optimisation, performance monitoring, and customer engagement as the highest-return deployment areas (Source: [AI Agent Adoption Statistics by Industry 2026 — Salesmate.io](https://www.salesmate.io/blog/ai-agents-adoption-statistics/)). Teams that deploy purpose-built AI agents across their operations report up to **50% efficiency gains** in the tasks those agents handle — time redirected towards strategic decisions that require human judgement, not repetitive execution.

## What the Agent Hub Contains

The Agent Hub organises your digital workforce into categories that map to the distinct operational domains of your business:

<div class="account-grid">
  <div class="type-card">
    <strong>Monitoring & Alerts</strong><br>
    Agents that watch your platforms continuously — detecting revenue anomalies, conversion drops, budget overspend, and site performance regressions before they cost you sales.
  </div>
  <div class="type-card">
    <strong>Site Optimisation</strong><br>
    Agents that analyse and improve your store's search visibility, Core Web Vitals scores, and product imagery — executing optimisation tasks that would take hours to complete manually.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="account-grid">
  <div class="type-card">
    <strong>Insights & Reporting</strong><br>
    Agents that analyse your performance data — from seasonal trend mapping and competitor benchmarking to product-level sales analysis and business KPI reporting.
  </div>
  <div class="type-card">
    <strong>Marketing & Operations</strong><br>
    Agents that connect directly to your advertising, email, and logistics platforms — surfacing campaign performance, managing workflows, and identifying spend inefficiencies across channels.
  </div>

## Step-by-Step: Using the Agent Hub

### Step 1: Open the Agent Hub

Click **Agent Hub** in the left-hand navigation sidebar. The Agent Hub home screen presents the full catalogue of agents available to your workspace, organised by category and displayed as visual agent cards. Each card shows:

- The agent's name and a brief description of what it does.
- The platform or platforms it operates on (Shopify, BigCommerce, Google Ads, etc.).
- A status indicator showing whether the agent is available on your current subscription plan.
- A pin icon to add the agent to your Pinned Agents section for quick access.

*The Agent Hub home screen: the full catalogue of available AI agents displayed as visual cards, organised by operational category — browse by platform, filter by outcome, and pin your most-used agents for instant access.*

### Step 2: Browse and Filter Agents

The Agent Hub catalogue is navigable in several ways:

- **Browse by Category** — scroll through agents organised by operational category: Monitoring & Alerts, Site Optimisation, Insights & Reporting, Operations & Reliability, and Marketing Integrations.
- **Filter by Platform** — view only agents designed for your connected platform: Shopify, BigCommerce, Adobe Commerce, Google Ads, GA4, and more.
- **Filter by Outcome** — narrow the catalogue to agents focused on a specific business goal: operations, automation, insights, monitoring, or optimisation.
- **Filter by Role** — find agents built for your team's function: marketer, merchant, developer, or executive.
- **Search by Name** — type any keyword to find agents by name or description instantly.

Agents that require a higher subscription tier than your current plan are displayed with an upgrade indicator — you can see exactly what each agent does and which plan includes it before making a decision.

### Step 3: Pin Your Most-Used Agents

Click the pin icon on any agent card to add it to your **Pinned Agents** section at the top of the catalogue. Pinned agents appear first whenever you open the Agent Hub, giving you instant access to your most frequently used digital workforce members without scrolling through the full catalogue.

Pins are saved per user — each team member can customise their own pinned agent layout without affecting anyone else's view.

### Step 4: Activate an Agent

To activate an agent and begin using it:

1. Click the agent's card to open its detail view.
2. Review the agent's description, supported platforms, and what it delivers.
3. Click **Activate** (or **Open** if the agent is already active for your workspace).
4. The agent opens in its dedicated workspace — either within Ask Viq as an inline agent card, or in its own full-screen interface depending on the agent type.

For agents that require a platform connection (for example, the Business KPI Agent for Shopify), you will be prompted to confirm which connected storefront to point the agent at before it begins working.

### Step 5: Manage Your Active Agent Workforce

Agents you have activated appear in your active agent roster, visible from the Agent Hub home screen. For each active agent, you can:

- **View activity** — see the agent's recent outputs and task history.
- **Adjust configuration** — modify the agent's target platform or scope.
- **Pause or deactivate** — suspend the agent's activity without losing its configuration or history.
- **Monitor performance** — review metrics on how the agent's outputs have affected your store's results.

## AI Safety & Guardrails

Every agent in the Agent Hub operates within Vortex IQ's **AI Guardrails** framework, providing consistent safety controls across your entire digital workforce.

**Subscription-Gated Access:**
Agent availability is enforced in real time based on your active subscription plan. Agents outside your plan are visible in the catalogue with an upgrade indicator — they cannot be activated until the appropriate plan is in place. This ensures your team members can only access the capabilities your organisation has explicitly authorised.

**Human-in-the-Loop Approval:**
When any agent proposes a change to your live store — such as updating a product description, publishing SEO changes, or modifying a campaign — an approval card appears in the workspace before anything is executed. The card shows exactly what the agent intends to do, what data informed the recommendation, and the expected outcome. You approve or decline with a single click. No agent acts on your live store unilaterally.

**Role-Based Activation:**
Agent activation and deactivation require Manager or Administrator privileges. Users with the Viewer role can browse the Agent Hub catalogue and review agent outputs but cannot activate, configure, or deactivate agents.

**Audit Trail:**
Every agent activation, configuration change, and approved agent action is logged automatically in your [Audit Trail](../governance/audit-trails.md). This creates a complete, searchable record of every decision made by your digital workforce and the humans who authorised them.

!!! tip "Agent Hub vs. AI Agent Library"
    The **AI Agent Library** in the Command Centre's left panel is a curated quick-launch catalogue designed for fast agent activation within an Ask Viq conversation thread. The **Agent Hub** (this portal) is the full management interface where you configure, monitor, manage, and track your entire digital workforce — including reviewing agent history, adjusting settings, and managing your pinned agent roster. Use the Agent Hub for workforce management; use the AI Agent Library for task-by-task activation within Ask Viq.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How do I know which agents are included in my current subscription plan?**
In the Agent Hub catalogue, agents included in your current plan display an **Activate** button. Agents that require a higher plan show an upgrade indicator with the plan name that includes them. Click any agent card to see its full description and plan requirement before making an upgrade decision.

**Q: Can I activate the same agent for multiple connected storefronts?**
Yes. If you have multiple stores connected to your workspace (for example, a Shopify store and a BigCommerce store), you can activate compatible agents for each store separately. Each activation is tracked independently in your audit trail and counts towards your plan's active agent limit.

**Q: What happens to an agent's output history when I deactivate it?**
Deactivating an agent pauses its activity immediately. Its configuration, output history, and settings are retained — you can reactivate it at any time and it will resume with the same settings intact. Deactivation does not delete the agent's history or require reconfiguration on reactivation.

**Q: Does pinning an agent affect my subscription's active agent limit?**
No. Pinning an agent is a display preference that moves it to the top of your Agent Hub catalogue view. Only activating an agent counts towards your plan's active agent limit. You can pin as many agents as you like without affecting your usage capacity.

**Q: How do agents in the Agent Hub relate to the AI agents I can activate through Ask Viq?**
They are the same agents. Agents you activate through the Agent Hub are the same capabilities that Ask Viq surfaces inline when your question requires specialised expertise. The Agent Hub gives you the management view — configuration, history, and control. Ask Viq gives you the activation shortcut — surface and deploy the right agent directly from a conversation without navigating away.
