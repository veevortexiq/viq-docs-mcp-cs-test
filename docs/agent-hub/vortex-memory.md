# Vortex Memory

Vortex Memory is a centralized file management and preview workspace within VortexIQ. It allows users to upload, organize, and access supporting files (any of these file types PDF, JPG, PNG, CSV (Max 50MB)) that can be referenced across the platform.

This page acts as a secure document repository connected to your store environment.

### Overview

The Vortex Memory interface is divided into three primary sections:

1. Header Bar
2. File Management Panel (Left Sidebar)
3. File Preview Workspace (Main Panel)

---

## 1. Header Bar

The top bar provides high-level system status and file metrics:

* **Files Count** – Displays the total number of uploaded files.
* **Storage Size** – Shows the cumulative storage usage.
* **Store Connected** – Indicates active connection to the store.
* **User Profile (Top Right)** – Displays the currently logged-in user.

This section gives quick visibility into storage usage and connection status.

---

## 2. File Management Panel (Left Sidebar)

This panel is used to manage and organize files.

### Search Files

A search input field allows users to quickly locate uploaded files by name.

### Upload Files

Users can upload files directly into Vortex Memory.

**Supported formats:**

* PDF
* JPG
* PNG
* CSV

**Maximum file size:** 50MB per file

Files uploaded here become available for preview and use within the system.

### Filters

The Filters section enables sorting or narrowing down files based on defined criteria (if configured).

### Empty State

If no files are uploaded, the system displays:

> “No files yet – Upload your first file to get started.”

## 3. File Preview Workspace (Main Panel)

The right-hand panel is the file preview area.

* When no file is selected, it displays:

  > “Select a file to preview – Click on any file from the left to view its contents here.”
* When a file is selected, its contents are rendered in this panel for viewing.

This separation ensures file management and file previewing remain cleanly organized.
