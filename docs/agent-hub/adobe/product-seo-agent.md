## Scenarios
Here are a few scenarios in which this agent can be helpful:

### Scenario 1: Optimizing a specific product
You can provide a product SKU to the agent. It will get the product's current SEO data, and then use its sub-agents to research relevant keywords and rewrite the product's name, description, and meta tags for better SEO. Once you approve the changes, the agent will update the product in your Magento store.

### Scenario 2: Finding and optimizing products with poor SEO
You can ask the agent to find products that need SEO improvement. It will scan your Magento store for products with missing SEO information (like empty meta descriptions). The agent will then show you a list of these products, and you can choose one to optimize.

### Scenario 3: Finding a product and then optimizing it
If you don't know the SKU of a product, you can provide a keyword or product name. The agent will search your Magento store and show you a list of matching products. You can then choose a product from the list to start the SEO optimization workflow.
