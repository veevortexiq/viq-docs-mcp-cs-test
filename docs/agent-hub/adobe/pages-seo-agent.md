Content Creation Workflow

**Subagent Description - Capabilities**.
This sub-agent is a two-step process for creating SEO-optimized content. First, an SEO Research Specialist analyzes your page and uses Google Search to find the best trending keywords. Then, an SEO Content Writer takes this information and crafts an optimized Meta Title, Meta Description, and Meta Keywords for your page, ensuring it follows your brand's voice and SEO best practices.

## Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Improve SEO for a Specific Page
You can ask VIQ to find a specific page on your Magento store, like your "About Us" page. VIQ will then analyze its current SEO, find better keywords, and suggest a new meta title, description, and keywords to help it rank higher in search results. You can then approve these changes, and VIQ will update the page for you.

### Scenario 2: Find and Optimize Underperforming Pages
If you're unsure which pages to optimize, you can ask VIQ to search for pages related to a certain topic, like "summer collection." VIQ will list the relevant pages, and you can choose one to work on. From there, VIQ will generate new SEO content to improve its visibility and attract more visitors.

### Scenario 3: Ensure Brand Consistency Across Pages
If you have a new set of brand guidelines, you can use VIQ to ensure your pages are compliant. VIQ will fetch your brand profiles and use them to generate SEO content that is consistent with your brand's tone and style. This is especially useful when you want to maintain a cohesive brand voice across your entire website.
