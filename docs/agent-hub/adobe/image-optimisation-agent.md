# Image Optimisation Agent

## Agent Overview

VIQ is a specialized AI assistant for the Vortex IQ platform, designed to help you manage product images in your Magento store. Its main purpose is to make your product images more attractive to customers. The agent's workflow is straightforward: you first find a product, and then you can manage its images. You can find products either by searching with a keyword or by providing a specific Product ID.

## Agent Tools

Here’s a simple overview of what this agent can do for you:

*   **Find Products by Keyword:** Easily search for your products by typing in a keyword.
*   **View Product Images:** See all the images for a product, including images for different variations like colors or sizes.
*   **Browse Many Images:** If a product has a lot of images, you can look through them page by page.
*   **Edit Images with AI:** Use artificial intelligence to edit your product images. Just describe the changes you want, like changing the background or improving the lighting.
*   **Add New Images:** Add a new image to your product from a web link.
*   **Replace an Image:** Swap an existing product image with a new one.
*   **Undo Image Changes:** If you're not happy with an image change, you can easily undo it and restore the previous version.

## Scenarios

Here are a few scenarios to illustrate what you can do with the Image Optimisation Magento Agent:

### Scenario 1: Find a Product and View Its Images
Imagine you want to check the images for your "Summer Dress" product.

1.  You can start by telling the agent: "I want to search for a product."
2.  The agent will ask for a keyword. You can say: "summer dress".
3.  The agent will show you a list of products that match your search.
4.  You can choose the correct product from the list, and the agent will then display all of its images, including any variations.

### Scenario 2: Edit a Product Image and Replace It
Let's say you have a product image with a plain background, and you want to make it more appealing.

1.  First, you find the product you want to work with.
2.  The agent will show you the images for that product. You can select an image to edit.
3.  You can then give a command like: "Change the background to a sunny beach."
4.  The agent will use AI to edit the image and show you the new version.
5.  If you like it, you can tell the agent to "replace the original image," and it will update the image in your Magento store.

### Scenario 3: Replace an Image and Then Undo the Change
Sometimes you might change your mind after updating an image.

1.  You've just replaced an image for one of your products with a new AI-edited version.
2.  After a moment, you decide you preferred the original one.
3.  You can simply tell the agent: "Undo my last change" or "Rollback the image."
4.  The agent will restore the original image, undoing the replacement.
