## Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Enhancing a Product Photo with AI
You want to make a product photo more appealing by changing its boring background. You can ask the agent to search for your product by its name, select the image you want to edit, and simply ask it to "change the background to a sunny beach." The agent will generate an updated image for you, which you can then save to your product gallery.

### Scenario 2: Adding a New Image and Making it the Star
You have a great new photo for one of your products and want it to be the first thing customers see. You can ask the agent to add the new image to the product's gallery. Once added, you can instruct it to "move this image to the first position," making it the new default display image for that product.

### Scenario 3: Trying Out a New Image and Reverting
You're not sure if a new image is better than the old one. You can use the agent to replace the original image with the new one. After seeing it live on the product page using the "Get Product Link" tool, you decide you prefer the old one. You can simply ask the agent to "undo" or "rollback" the change, and it will instantly restore the original image.
