## Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Analyze Sales Performance and Plan a Promotion
A user can ask, "How did my top-selling product perform last month?". The AI Growth Advisor will delegate this to the *VortexIQ KPI Analyst - Shopify*. After getting the sales data, the user could then ask, "What are some upcoming holidays where I can promote this product?". The advisor would then bring in the *VortexIQ Seasonal Insights Agent* to provide relevant marketing event ideas.

### Scenario 2: Competitor Research and Website Benchmarking
A user might want to know, "Who are my main competitors?". The advisor will use the *VortexIQ Competitor Finder*. Once a competitor is identified, the user could follow up with, "How does my website speed compare to theirs?". The *VortexIQ PageSpeed Agent* would then be engaged to provide a comparative performance analysis.

### Scenario 3: Understanding a Generated Report
If a user has a report ready, they can start by saying, "I have a question about my latest product performance report." The AI Growth Advisor will use its **Get Report** tool to access the report's content and then answer specific questions like, "Which products had the lowest sales last quarter?" based on the information in the report.
