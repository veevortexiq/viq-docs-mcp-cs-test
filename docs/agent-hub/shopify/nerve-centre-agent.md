# Nerve Centre Agent

## Agent Overview

The Nerve Centre agent is designed to help you with your Shopify store. It focuses on improving your store's performance by managing and optimizing large banner images. When an image is optimized to load faster, this agent will notify you, show you a preview on a test site, and with your approval, move it to your live production store. It aims to make your website faster and more efficient.

## Agent Tools

- **Banner Image Migration**: This tool automates the process of updating your Shopify store's main banner image. It takes an optimized, faster-loading image and replaces the old one on your homepage, helping to improve your site's performance.

## Sub-agents

This agent does not have any sub-agents.

## Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Improving Page Load Speed
An agent has identified a large banner image on your Shopify store that is slowing down your page load time. It optimizes the image and moves it to a staging site. The Nerve Centre Agent then alerts you about the optimized image, providing details on the size reduction and a link to the staging site to review the changes. You can then approve the change, and the agent will automatically update your production site with the new, faster-loading banner.

### Scenario 2: Approving Changes from Staging to Production
You receive a notification from the Nerve Centre Agent that an optimized banner is ready for review on a staging site. After checking the staging site and confirming that you are happy with the improved performance and appearance, you can simply tell the agent to proceed. The agent will then migrate the optimized banner to your live production site, ensuring a seamless update for your customers.

### Scenario 3: Rolling Back Unsatisfactory Changes
After the optimized banner has been moved to the production site, you notice an issue or are not satisfied with the new look. You can inform the Nerve Centre Agent, which gives you the option to roll back the changes. With your confirmation, the agent can revert the banner to its previous version, restoring your store's earlier appearance.
