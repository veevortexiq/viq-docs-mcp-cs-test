## Agent Overview

The Shopify Discount Creator is your helpful assistant for making discount codes for your Shopify store. It's designed to guide you through the process of creating new promotions, asking for all the necessary details to get your discount set up correctly. It can create percentage-based discounts and schedule them to start on a specific date.

## Agent Tools

This agent has one primary capability:

-   **Create Shopify Discount**: This allows the agent to generate new discount codes for your online store. You can tell it the name of the discount, the code you want customers to use, the percentage off, and the date the discount should become active.

## Sub-agents

This agent does not have any sub-agents.

## Scenarios

Here are a few examples of what the Shopify Discount Creator can help you with:

### Scenario 1: Holiday Sale Promotion
You want to run a holiday sale. You can ask the agent to create a "25% off" discount for your customers. The agent will ask you for a title for the promotion (like "Holiday Special"), a discount code (like "HOLIDAY25"), and when you want the sale to begin.

### Scenario 2: Flash Sale Coupon
If you want to create a quick, limited-time offer, you can ask the agent to generate a flash sale coupon. For example, you could create a "50% off" discount called "FLASH50" to boost sales.

### Scenario 3: Welcome Discount for New Customers
To encourage new shoppers, you can have the agent create a special welcome discount. You could set up a "10% off" coupon with the code "WELCOME10" that new customers can use on their first purchase.
