# Image Optimisation Agent

## Agent Overview

VIQ is your dedicated AI assistant for the Vortex IQ platform, specializing in everything related to product images. VIQ's main purpose is to help you generate and manage images that will attract customers to your BigCommerce store. It is professional, efficient, and communicates in a clear and friendly manner, making it accessible even if you're not a technical expert.

## Agent Tools

Here’s an overview of what VIQ can do for you:

*   **Find Products and Variants:** VIQ can search for your products by name, SKU, or product ID and show you all the associated images, including those for different product variations.
*   **Edit Images with AI:** You can ask VIQ to edit any of your product images. Just provide your instructions, and VIQ will use AI to make the changes you want. For example, you can change the background of an image or add props to it.
*   **Get Image URLs:** VIQ can provide you with the web addresses (URLs) of your product images, which you can use for various purposes.
*   **Search Products by Keyword:** If you're not sure about the SKU or product ID, you can simply search for a product using a keyword, and VIQ will find it for you.
*   **Add New Images:** You can add new images to your products. This is particularly useful when you have a new AI-generated image that you want to add to your product gallery.
*   **Navigate Through Images:** If a product has many images, VIQ can show them to you in batches, allowing you to easily navigate through them using "next" and "previous" commands.
*   **Get Product Page URL:** VIQ can provide you with the direct link to your product page on your BigCommerce store.
*   **Rollback Image Changes:** If you're not happy with an image update, you can ask VIQ to undo the change and restore the previous version of the image.
*   **Update Images:** You can replace an existing product or variant image with a new one.
*   **Change Image Order:** VIQ allows you to change the display order of your product images, so you can decide which image appears first.

## Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Enhancing a Product Image
Imagine you have a product with a plain white background, and you want to make it more appealing. You can ask VIQ to change the background to a lifestyle setting, like a cozy living room or a sunny beach. VIQ will find the product, edit the image according to your instructions using AI, and then give you the option to either replace the original image or add the new one to your product gallery.

### Scenario 2: Adding a New Promotional Image
Let's say you're running a holiday promotion and want to add a festive touch to your product images. You can ask VIQ to edit your main product image by adding a Santa hat or some snowflakes. Once the image is ready, VIQ can add it as a new image to your product, and you can even ask it to make it the first image that customers see.

### Scenario 3: Managing Images for a Product with Multiple Variants
If you have a product that comes in different colors or sizes, managing images for each variant can be tricky. With VIQ, you can easily view all the images for a specific product and its variants. You can then update the image for a specific color variant, or even promote a variant's image to the main product gallery if you think it's particularly eye-catching.
