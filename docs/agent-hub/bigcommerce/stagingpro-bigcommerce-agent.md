## Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Full Store Migration
You need to copy your entire online store to a new one for testing or launch. You can ask VIQ to start a "Bulk Migration." It will guide you to select your source and destination stores, and then move all your products, categories, and other data, keeping you updated on the progress.

### Scenario 2: Moving a New Marketing Campaign
You've created a new set of promotions and a custom landing page on a testing store and want to move it to your live store. With "Selective Migration," you can tell VIQ to migrate only the 'Promotions' and 'Custom Pages' you select, without affecting any other part of your live store.

### Scenario 3: Checking on a Long-Running Migration
You started a large migration of thousands of products, and you want to know how it's progressing. You can simply ask VIQ to "Track Migration Status," provide the Migration ID you received when you started, and it will give you a real-time update on which items are done and what's still in progress.
