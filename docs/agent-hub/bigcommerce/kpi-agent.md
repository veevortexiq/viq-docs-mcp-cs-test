### Scenario 1: Get a quick overview of your business health
You can ask the agent, "**How is my business doing?**"

The agent will analyze your total sales, number of orders, and new customer registrations to give you a comprehensive summary of your store's recent performance. It will then provide recommendations, such as suggesting a marketing campaign if customer growth is slow.

The agent will analyze how much revenue is generated from discounted orders and compare it to the total value of the discounts offered. This will help you understand the return on investment for your promotions and decide if they are a good strategy for your business.
