# Image Compression Agent

## Agent Overview

The Image Compression Agent is a specialized assistant designed to enhance the performance of your BigCommerce store by optimizing product images. It helps you easily find products, compress their images to reduce file size and improve page load times, and manage your visual assets directly. With tools to update, add, or even roll back changes, this agent provides a simple and effective way to ensure your store's images are both high-quality and web-friendly.

## Agent Tools

VIQ comes equipped with a variety of tools to help you manage your product images:

*   **Find Products and Images:** VIQ can search for products in your BigCommerce store by keyword, or you can provide a Product ID or SKU directly. It can then fetch and display all the images associated with that product, including images for different product variations.
*   **Compress Images:** You can ask VIQ to compress any product image to reduce its file size, which can help your website load faster. You can choose from low, medium, or high compression levels.
*   **Update and Add Images:** After an image has been compressed, you can choose to replace the original image or add the new, compressed image to the product's image gallery.
*   **View and Verify Changes:** VIQ can provide you with a direct link to the product page on your BigCommerce store so you can see the changes you've made. It will also let you know if the product is currently visible to your customers.
*   **Rollback Changes:** If you're not happy with an image update, you can easily undo the change and revert to the previous image with a simple "rollback" command.

## Scenarios

Here are a few scenarios where the Image Compression Agent can be particularly helpful:

### Scenario 1: Improving Website Performance
Your online store has beautiful, high-resolution images, but they are causing your product pages to load slowly. You can use the Image Compression Agent to quickly compress the images for your most popular products. By choosing a medium compression level, you can significantly reduce the image file sizes without a noticeable loss in quality, making your pages load faster for a better customer experience.

### Scenario 2: Updating Product Variants
You've just received new photos for a specific color variation of a popular product. Instead of manually uploading them through the BigCommerce admin panel, you can ask VIQ to find the product by its SKU. VIQ will then display all the images for that product, including the ones for the different color variants. You can then have VIQ replace the old image for that specific color with the new one you provide.

### Scenario 3: Quickly Adding a New Promotional Image
You have a new promotional image for a product that you want to add to its image gallery. You can simply ask VIQ to find the product by its name, and then provide the new image. VIQ can add it to the product's image gallery, and you can then ask for the product page URL to immediately see how it looks on your live store.
