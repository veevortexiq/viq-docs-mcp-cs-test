### Page SEO Optimization Agent

- **Description & Capabilities:** This specialist agent handles the entire process of editing widget content. It will guide you step-by-step through selecting a channel, choosing a page, and picking a widget to edit. It can then help you generate new, SEO-friendly content for that widget that aligns with your brand's voice and style.

## Scenarios

Here are a few scenarios where this agent can be particularly helpful:

### Scenario 1: Updating a Homepage Banner
You want to update the text on a promotional banner on your homepage to make it more engaging. You can ask the agent to "edit the homepage," and it will show you all the widgets on that page. You can then select the banner widget and have the agent help you write new, compelling copy for it.

### Scenario 2: Optimizing Content for a New Market
You've recently launched a new storefront for a different country and want to make sure the content is tailored for that market. You can use the agent to select your new channel, view its pages, and then edit the widgets to better resonate with the local audience.

### Scenario 3: Improving SEO on a Custom Page
You have a custom "About Us" page and you want to improve its search engine ranking. The agent can help you identify the widgets on that page and then work with you to rewrite the text to include relevant keywords and a stronger call-to-action, all while staying true to your brand's identity.
