# The Command Centre

**The Command Centre is the heart of the Vortex IQ AI OS — your single pane of glass for every metric, agent, and insight that matters to your business. It consolidates your store health, marketing performance, and AI agent activity into one intelligent interface, eliminating the need to switch between dozens of disconnected browser tabs.**

## Why a Single Pane of Glass Changes Everything

The average digital worker toggles between applications and websites **nearly 1,200 times per day**, losing up to **40% of their productivity** due to constant context switching (Source: [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org); [American Psychological Association — Context Switching Research](https://www.apa.org)). For eCommerce operators managing a Shopify store, Google Analytics, ad platforms, email tools, and inventory systems simultaneously, this fragmentation is even more acute — and the cost is measured in missed signals, delayed responses, and lost revenue.

The Command Centre was engineered to end this. Instead of logging into seven different platforms to understand your business, you arrive in a single workspace where Vortex IQ has already assembled the picture. Brands using unified commerce solutions report **36% higher checkout conversion** and **22% lower total cost of ownership** compared to multi-vendor stacks requiring constant integration work (Source: [Shopify — Unified Commerce Software Guide 2025](https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/blog/unified-commerce-software)). And merchants using the Command Centre report a **50% reduction in the time spent on daily operational reviews** — time redirected towards strategy, not status checking.

The shift to unified intelligence isn't a future trend. It is the operating model of the highest-performing eCommerce teams today.

## The Three Zones of Your Command Centre

The Command Centre interface is organised into three purposeful areas that work together to give you situational awareness and the ability to act:

### Zone 1: The AI Agent Library (Left Panel)

The left panel is your **AI Agent Library** — the catalogue of every specialised agent available for your store. Agents are grouped by capability: Product Optimisation, Website Performance, Campaign Management, and more. Browse the library to discover which agents are active, which are ready to activate, and which tasks are being handled autonomously on your behalf right now.

### Zone 2: The Command Centre Workspace (Centre)

The main workspace opens with the **Ask Viq** conversational interface — your 24/7 AI analyst, ready to answer questions, retrieve insights, or hand off to a specialised agent. On first load, you see the **"Welcome to your Command Centre"** screen with four guided question categories to help you explore the platform:

- **Understanding the Basics** — What is Vortex IQ? How does an AI OS differ from the tools I already use?
- **Features & Capabilities** — What platforms does it connect to? Can it help with SEO and analytics?
- **For Your Business** — Who is this for? How does it increase revenue or cut costs?
- **Getting Started** — How long to set up? What does the free plan include?

Once a conversation begins, this area transforms into a full chat interface with message history, agent hand-offs, and results delivered directly in the thread.

### Zone 3: Settings & History (Right Panel)

The right panel provides three contextual tools accessible from within any session:

- **Viq Persona** — View and update the active AI persona configuration for this workspace session.
- **Quick Prompts** — A curated library of one-click prompt starters to accelerate common tasks.
- **Chat History** — Browse and reload previous conversation threads without losing context.

## Outcome & Impact: What the Command Centre Delivers

Beyond consolidating information, the Command Centre changes the operational rhythm of your entire team. Rather than reactive firefighting — discovering problems only after customers report them — you operate from a position of real-time awareness.

**For operators:** The Nerve Centre's Signal Alerts surface in the Command Centre the moment an anomaly is detected — a traffic drop, a checkout error, a payment gateway timeout — allowing you to respond in minutes rather than hours. eCommerce businesses adopting AI-powered automation and unified dashboards report a **45% improvement in ROI** and an **80% increase in lead generation efficiency** compared to those using fragmented point tools (Source: [Envive.ai — AI Personalization in eCommerce Statistics 2026](https://www.envive.ai/post/ai-personalization-in-ecommerce-lift-statistics)).

**For teams:** The role-based Command Centre means every team member sees the data relevant to their responsibilities without overwhelming them with irrelevant metrics. Administrators see the full picture; Managers see agent activity and approval queues; Viewers see performance dashboards. Retailers that have fully embedded AI into their customer journey are reporting **15 to 25% revenue increases** — and this starts with giving each team member a clear, relevant view of the business (Source: [McKinsey & Company — The Value of Getting Personalisation Right](https://www.mckinsey.com)).

## Step-by-Step: Navigating the Command Centre

### Step 1: Understanding the Sidebar

The left-hand sidebar is the navigation spine of your entire AI Operating System. It is always visible and organises every capability into a logical hierarchy:

**Primary Navigation (top):**
- **Ask Viq** — Your conversational AI for data retrieval, analysis, and task delegation.
- **Vortex Mind** — Strategic insights, generated reports, and scheduled intelligence briefings.
- **Nerve Centre** — Real-time monitoring dashboards for every connected platform.
- **Vortex Apps** — Access to StagingPro (BigCommerce) and Vortex Backup tools.
- **Agent Hub** — Your digital workforce management portal — hire, monitor, and manage AI agents.

**Secondary Navigation (bottom):**
- **Vortex Memory** — Knowledge management centre where you store brand guidelines and policies.
- **Get Support** — Direct access to help documentation and the Vortex IQ support team.
- **Settings** — Platform configuration, connected sources, user management, and AI Guardrails.
- **Log Out** — Secure session termination.

![Ask Viq chat interface showing Ask Viq branding, conversation thread, user and AI message bubbles, and the Ask VIQ anything input field at the bottom](<../aios screenshots/ask viq chat ui.png>)

*The active Command Centre chat interface: the Ask Viq® conversational workspace with the "Ask VIQ anything…" input field, AI and user message bubbles, and the full left-hand sidebar navigation visible — Ask Viq, Vortex Mind, Nerve Centre, Vortex Apps, Agent Hub (top) and Vortex Memory, Get Support, Settings, Log Out (bottom).*

### Step 2: Starting a Conversation with Ask Viq

From any page in the Command Centre, you can open a conversation with Ask Viq. Simply type in the **"Ask VIQ anything…"** input field at the bottom of the workspace and press Enter.

Ask Viq understands natural language — no special syntax, no commands. For example:

- *"How did our revenue perform last week compared to the week before?"*
- *"What's causing the drop in conversion rate I'm seeing today?"*
- *"Show me which products are running low on inventory."*
- *"Draft a re-engagement email for customers who haven't purchased in 60 days."*

If your question requires a specialised agent — such as the Product SEO Agent or the Google Ads Performance Agent — Ask Viq will surface the relevant agent card directly in the chat thread and offer to activate it with a single click.

### Step 3: Launching Vortex Apps

The **Vortex Apps** section of the sidebar provides access to enterprise-grade tools including StagingPro for BigCommerce and Vortex Backup. App access is determined by your subscription plan — apps included in your plan are available immediately; apps not on your current plan display an upgrade prompt.

![Vortex Apps home screen showing the apps available to your workspace](<../aios screenshots/vortexiq-apps-home.png>)

*The Vortex Apps home screen, showing the suite of enterprise tools available within your workspace. App availability is determined by your subscription plan.*

### Step 4: Checking Your Usage at a Glance

The Command Centre surfaces your workspace usage metrics so you can see at a glance how much of your plan capacity is in use. Usage indicators include:

- **Active Agents** — How many AI agents are currently deployed versus your plan's agent limit.
- **Connected Integrations** — How many platform connections are active versus your allowance.
- **Team Members** — How many users are active in your workspace versus your plan's user limit.

If you are approaching a limit, the Command Centre surfaces an inline upgrade prompt so you can expand your capacity without interrupting your workflow.

## AI Safety & Guardrails: Control from Every Screen

The Command Centre is designed around one principle: **you are always in control**. Every AI action that could affect your live store or team requires your explicit approval before it executes — regardless of which interface you use to access it.

**Human-in-the-Loop by Design:**
When Ask Viq or any deployed agent proposes a high-impact action — such as updating product descriptions, adjusting pricing rules, or triggering a bulk content task — an **approval card** appears in the Command Centre workspace. The card shows exactly what the agent intends to do, why it recommends the action, and what the expected outcome is. You approve or decline with a single click.

**Audit Trail Integration:**
Every action surfaced through the Command Centre — approvals, rejections, agent activations, conversation summaries — is logged automatically in your [Audit Trail](governance/audit-trails.md). This creates a complete, searchable history of every decision made by your team and your AI workforce.

**Subscription-Gated Access:**
App access, agent limits, and integration allowances are enforced in real time based on your active subscription plan. This means team members can only access the capabilities their role and plan permit — no accidental overreach, no unexpected charges.

!!! note "Role-Based Visibility"
    What you see in the Command Centre depends on your access role. Administrators see all dashboards, approval queues, and settings. Managers see agent activity and can approve actions. Users (Viewers) can navigate the workspace and read insights but cannot approve actions or modify agent configuration.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What is the Command Centre and how is it different from a regular analytics dashboard?**
The Command Centre is not a passive reporting tool — it is an active, AI-powered workspace. Unlike traditional dashboards that display historical data you must interpret manually, the Command Centre surfaces real-time alerts, AI-generated recommendations, and a conversational interface that lets you ask questions and take action in the same place. It is the difference between reading a report and having a senior analyst at your side at all times.

**Q: Can I access the Command Centre on mobile devices?**
Yes. The Vortex IQ Command Centre is a fully responsive web application, accessible from any modern browser on desktop, tablet, or mobile. For the best experience managing agents and reviewing detailed reports, a desktop or laptop screen is recommended.

**Q: Why do some Vortex Apps show an upgrade prompt?**
App access is gated by your subscription plan. Apps shown with an upgrade prompt are not included in your current plan. Click the upgrade prompt to see the plan that includes that app, or contact the Vortex IQ support team to discuss options for your workspace.

**Q: Does the Chat History persist between sessions?**
Yes. Every conversation with Ask Viq is saved to your Chat History. You can reload any previous thread from the right panel's **Chat History** tab, allowing you to continue a previous analysis or share context with a team member.

**Q: How does the AI Agent Library differ from the Agent Hub?**
The **AI Agent Library** in the Command Centre's left panel shows a curated catalogue of agents available for quick activation — optimised for discovery. The **Agent Hub** (accessible from the sidebar) is the full management portal where you configure active agents, set Guardrails, review performance metrics, and manage your complete digital workforce.
