## Why a Conversational AI Analyst Changes Everything

The traditional eCommerce reporting stack requires you to log into one platform for traffic data, another for ad performance, a third for revenue trends — and then manually reconcile all three before you can even form an opinion. By the time the picture is clear, the moment for action has passed.

Ask Viq eliminates this cycle. It connects to every data source you have linked in your workspace and answers questions across all of them in a single, natural-language conversation. The business impact of this shift is measurable: merchants who engage with conversational AI interfaces experience conversion rates **4x higher** than those relying on traditional self-service tools, and customers who interact with AI-driven chat complete their tasks **47% faster** (Source: [HelloRep.ai — The Future of AI in eCommerce 2025](https://www.hellorep.ai/blog/the-future-of-ai-in-ecommerce-40-statistics-on-conversational-ai-agents-for-2025)).

At the organisation level, the gains compound. Companies deploying conversational AI report a **94% boost in team productivity**, a **92% improvement in issue resolution speed**, and a **65% reduction in operational costs** (Source: IBM Research via [Master of Code — State of Conversational AI 2026](https://masterofcode.com/blog/conversational-ai-trends)). For eCommerce operators, this translates directly to faster decisions, fewer missed signals, and more time spent on strategy rather than status checking.

AI-powered, context-aware intelligence — the same capability that powers Ask Viq's responses — can increase revenue by up to **41%** for merchants who apply it consistently (Source: [Envive.ai — AI Personalization in eCommerce Lift Statistics 2026](https://www.envive.ai/post/ai-personalization-in-ecommerce-lift-statistics)).

## What Ask Viq Can Do

Ask Viq handles three distinct types of work within a single conversation:

### Data Retrieval
Pull any metric from your connected platforms without switching to a separate dashboard:
- *"How did revenue perform last week compared to the same period last month?"*
- *"Which products have the lowest conversion rate in the last 30 days?"*
- *"What is my current return on ad spend across Google and Facebook?"*

### Creative Execution
Draft outreach, content, and communications using your live store data as context:
- *"Draft a re-engagement email for customers who have not purchased in 60 days."*
- *"Write product descriptions for the five items with the highest return rate."*
- *"Suggest three promotional angles based on our best-selling categories this season."*

### Agent Activation
When your request requires specialised expertise — SEO optimisation, image compression, ad analysis — Ask Viq surfaces the relevant agent directly in the chat thread and offers to activate it with a single click. You do not need to navigate to the Agent Hub separately.

## Step-by-Step: Using Ask Viq

### Step 1: Access the Ask Viq Workspace

Click **Ask Viq** in the left-hand navigation sidebar from any page in the Command Centre. On your first visit — or at the start of a fresh session — you arrive at the **Ask Viq welcome screen**, organised into three areas:

- **Left panel: AI Agent Library** — browse and activate specialised agents by category.
- **Centre: Conversation workspace** — your main chat area, with guided question categories to help you explore the platform.
- **Right panel: Session tools** — access **Viq Persona**, **Quick Prompts**, and **Chat History**.

The centre panel displays four guided question categories to help new users orient quickly:
- **Understanding the Basics** — What is Vortex IQ? How does it differ from the tools I already use?
- **Features & Capabilities** — What platforms does it connect to? Can it help with SEO and analytics?
- **For Your Business** — Who is this for? How does it increase revenue or cut costs?
- **Getting Started** — How long does setup take? What does the free plan include?

*The Ask Viq welcome screen: the AI Agent Library panel (left), four guided capability categories in the main workspace (centre), and the session tools panel with Viq Persona, Quick Prompts, and Chat History tabs (right).*

### Step 2: Start a Conversation

Type any question in the **"Ask VIQ anything…"** input field at the bottom of the workspace and press Enter. Ask Viq understands natural language — no special commands, no fixed query syntax required.

Once a conversation begins, the workspace transforms into a full chat interface. Your messages appear on the right; Ask Viq's responses appear on the left, clearly labelled with the **Ask Viq®** identity. Each conversation is assigned a unique session identifier, making it easy to locate and reload the thread later from Chat History.

*The active Ask Viq chat interface: the Ask Viq® branded workspace with a live conversation thread, user and AI message bubbles clearly distinguished, and the persistent "Ask VIQ anything…" input field at the bottom.*

### Step 3: Work with Specialised Agents

When your request requires a dedicated AI specialist, Ask Viq automatically identifies the most relevant agent and surfaces it as a card in the conversation thread. Each agent is purpose-built for a specific domain and platform. Activating it requires a single click — you never need to leave the chat.

**Product Optimisation Agents** — Optimise listings, page content, and imagery across your connected storefronts:

*Ask Viq activating the Page Content SEO and GEO agent for Shopify — the agent card appears in the conversation thread with optimisation task results delivered inline.*

![Ask Viq running the Product Image Optimisation agent for Shopify, showing image compression results in the chat thread](<../aios screenshots/ask viq - product optimisation - product Image optimisaiton for Shopify.png>)

*The Product Image Optimisation agent for Shopify — compressing and optimising product images to improve page load speed and Core Web Vitals performance, delivered inline in the conversation.*

**Website Performance Agents** — Diagnose and analyse site health directly in the conversation:

![Ask Viq running the Google Ads Performance agent showing campaign-level analysis and spend efficiency insights in the chat thread](<../aios screenshots/ask viq - website performance - google ads performance.png>)

*The Google Ads Performance agent in action within Ask Viq — delivering campaign-level analysis and spend efficiency insights without leaving the chat interface.*

![Ask Viq running the Google Analytics Insights agent showing traffic and audience behaviour data](<../aios screenshots/ask viq - website performance - google analytics insights.png>)

*Google Analytics Insights delivered inline in the Ask Viq conversation — traffic trends, audience behaviour, and goal completion data without switching to a separate analytics platform.*

*The Core Web Vitals agent surfaces Largest Contentful Paint, Cumulative Layout Shift, and Interaction to Next Paint scores directly in the conversation, paired with actionable improvement recommendations.*

**Campaign & Marketing Agents:**

*The Dotdigital Campaign Manager agent running within Ask Viq — delivering email campaign performance data and suggested next actions in a single, continuous thread.*

*The Image Compression agent activated via Ask Viq — processing and optimising store imagery to reduce page weight and improve loading performance.*

### Step 4: Browse and Reload Chat History

Every conversation with Ask Viq is automatically saved. To return to a previous session:

1. Click the **Chat History** tab in the right panel.
2. Browse your previous threads — each is displayed with a timestamp and a preview of the opening message.
3. Click any thread to reload the full conversation and continue exactly where you left off.

Chat History persists across sessions and devices. You can reload a conversation that began days ago and resume the analysis without any loss of context.

### Step 5: Use Quick Prompts

The **Quick Prompts** tab in the right panel contains a curated library of one-click prompt starters for the most common eCommerce analysis tasks. Click any prompt to pre-fill the input field, then send it immediately or customise it first. Quick Prompts reduce the time from "I have a question" to "I have an answer" for your most frequent queries.

## AI Safety & Guardrails

Every response from Ask Viq and every agent it activates operates within Vortex IQ's **AI Guardrails** framework — the same governance layer that applies across the entire platform.

**Human-in-the-Loop Approval:**
When Ask Viq or an activated agent proposes a high-impact action — such as publishing updated product content, adjusting a campaign budget, or triggering a bulk operation — an **approval card** appears in the conversation thread. The card shows exactly what the agent intends to do, the data used to reach that recommendation, and the expected outcome. You approve or decline with a single click. No action executes automatically.

**Read-Only by Default:**
All platform connections use read-only access as a default. Ask Viq can retrieve, analyse, and present any data from your connected sources without modifying anything. Write-level actions — publishing content, updating listings, adjusting settings — only proceed after explicit approval from a user with Manager or Administrator privileges.

**Audit Trail:**
Every approved action, declined recommendation, and agent activation within Ask Viq is logged automatically in your [Audit Trail](governance/audit-trails.md). This creates a complete, searchable record of every decision made through the conversational interface.

**Persona Configuration:**
The **Viq Persona** tab in the right panel allows Administrators to view and update the active AI persona — including the communication style, response focus, and any brand-specific guardrails applied to this workspace session.

!!! note "Role-Based Access"
    Administrators and Managers can approve agent actions directly from within Ask Viq. Users with the Viewer role can interact with Ask Viq and read insights, but cannot approve or trigger high-impact actions.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Does Ask Viq require any special syntax or commands?**
No. Ask Viq understands natural language — type your question exactly as you would ask a colleague. There is no query language, no commands, and no structured input format required. The more context you include in your question, the more precise the answer.

**Q: Can Ask Viq access data from multiple connected platforms in the same response?**
Yes. Ask Viq draws on all your connected data sources simultaneously. If your question involves both Google Ads performance and Shopify revenue, Ask Viq correlates the data across both sources and delivers a unified answer without requiring you to switch platforms.

**Q: How long is Chat History retained?**
Chat History is retained for the lifetime of your workspace. Every conversation is stored and searchable from the Chat History tab in the right panel. You can reload any previous session and continue the conversation from the exact point where it left off.

**Q: What happens when Ask Viq activates a specialised agent?**
When a specialised agent is activated, it appears as an embedded card in the conversation thread. The agent performs its analysis or task and delivers results inline — you see the full output without leaving the chat. If the agent proposes changes to your live store, an approval card appears and requires your explicit confirmation before anything is published or modified.

**Q: Is Ask Viq available on mobile devices?**
Yes. The entire Vortex IQ Command Centre, including Ask Viq, is accessible from any modern web browser on desktop, tablet, or mobile. For managing agent outputs and reviewing detailed analysis, a desktop or laptop screen provides the best experience.
