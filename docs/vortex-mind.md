# Vortex Mind

**Vortex Mind is the proactive strategic intelligence layer of the Vortex IQ AI OS. While Ask Viq answers questions on demand, Vortex Mind continuously analyses your performance data and generates comprehensive intelligence reports — including KPI analysis, product performance reviews, competitive benchmarking, and strategic recommendations — either on demand or on a schedule you define. It is the difference between reacting to data and being briefed before the meeting starts.**

## Why Strategic Intelligence Matters More Than Reactive Reporting

Most eCommerce teams operate in reactive mode: a metric drops, someone notices, a meeting is called, and by the time a response is agreed upon, the opportunity has passed. Traditional analytics dashboards make data available, but they do not surface insight — they require a human analyst to spot the pattern, form the hypothesis, and draft the recommendation.

Vortex Mind changes this by functioning as a proactive intelligence partner. It scans your connected data continuously and synthesises findings into structured reports that combine context, comparison, and recommended action in a single document.

The commercial case for this shift is significant. AI-powered business intelligence and personalisation can increase revenue by up to **41%** for merchants who apply it consistently, and companies that excel at data-driven decision-making are reported to be significantly more likely to outperform competitors in customer acquisition and profitability (Source: [Envive.ai — AI Personalization in eCommerce Lift Statistics 2026](https://www.envive.ai/post/ai-personalization-in-ecommerce-lift-statistics); McKinsey & Company). For teams managing the daily complexity of multi-channel eCommerce, Vortex Mind delivers a structured answer to one of the most valuable questions in business: *not just what happened, but what it means and what to do next*.

The impact on operational efficiency is equally clear. **89% of companies report positive ROI from AI-powered personalisation and intelligence tools**, with an average payback period of just 9 months (Source: [Envive.ai — AI Implementation Statistics 2026](https://www.envive.ai/post/ai-implementation-statistics-define-digital-success)). Merchants who adopt automated intelligence briefings consistently report reducing the time spent on weekly performance reviews by **up to 50%** — time redirected towards the strategic decisions that require human judgement (Source: [EComposer — AI in eCommerce Statistics 2025](https://ecomposer.io/blogs/ecommerce/ai-in-ecommerce-statistics)).

## Step-by-Step: Using Vortex Mind

### Step 1: Open Vortex Mind

Click **Vortex Mind** in the left-hand navigation sidebar. The Vortex Mind home screen presents an overview of the platform's capabilities alongside a video walkthrough and the four core feature tiles: **KPI Analysis**, **Product Performance**, **Competitor Analysis**, and **Strategic Recommendations**.

From this screen you have two primary actions available:
- **Generate a Report** — create a new intelligence report from your connected data, on demand.
- **View Reports** — access your full report history, individual report documents, and scheduled report management.

*The Vortex Mind home screen: four intelligence pillars presented as feature tiles — KPI Analysis, Product Performance, Competitor Analysis, and Strategic Recommendations — with direct action buttons to generate a new report or browse existing reports.*

### Step 2: Generate a Report

Click **Generate a Report**. The report generation screen presents a structured configuration form with three elements:

1. **Select Store** — choose which connected storefront this report should analyse.
2. **Select Date Range** — define the reporting period for the analysis.
3. **Choose Report Sections** — an accordion selector lets you choose which intelligence sections to include. Available sections are:
   - **Introduction** — executive overview of highlights and anomalies for the period
   - **Competitive Analysis** — benchmarking against industry trends and competitive signals
   - **Benchmark** — performance comparison against your historical baselines
   - **KPI** — deep-dive analysis of your key performance indicators
   - **Seasonal** — seasonal trend analysis and upcoming opportunity mapping
   - **Product** — product-level performance review across your catalogue
   - **Podcast** — a downloadable audio summary of the full report

Once configured, Vortex Mind assembles the selected sections from your live connected data and delivers the completed report to your **View Reports** tab.

![Vortex Mind Generate Report screen showing store selector, date range picker, and the section accordion with Introduction, Competitive Analysis, Benchmark, KPI, Seasonal, Product, and Podcast options](<../aios screenshots/vortex mind - generate report.png>)

*The Generate Report configuration screen: select your store and date range, then use the section accordion to choose which intelligence modules to include — from KPI deep-dives to the Podcast audio briefing.*

### Step 3: View Your Reports

Click the **View Reports** tab to access your complete report history. Each report in the list displays the store it covers, the date range analysed, the sections included, and the date it was generated. Click any report to open the full document.

![Vortex Mind View Reports tab showing the report history list with store name, date range, included sections, and generation timestamps for each report](<../aios screenshots/vortex mind - view reports tab.png>)

*The View Reports tab: a chronological list of all generated intelligence reports, each showing the store analysed, the reporting period, and the sections included — click any entry to open the full report document.*

### Step 4: Read and Download Individual Reports

Opening a report reveals the full structured intelligence document. Each section expands to show the analysis, benchmarks, and recommendations for that area of your business. If you included the **Podcast** section in your report configuration, a download control appears at the top of the report — click it to download the audio briefing version of the same intelligence content.

![Individual Vortex Mind report view showing expandable structured intelligence sections and the podcast download control at the top of the document](<../aios screenshots/vortex mind - view reports- individual report and poscast download ui.png>)

*An individual Vortex Mind report: structured intelligence sections expand inline, and the podcast download control appears at the top of the document for audio-format consumption of the same insights.*

### Step 5: Schedule Automated Reports

To receive intelligence briefings on a recurring schedule without manual generation, navigate to the **Scheduled Reports** tab within View Reports. Your existing scheduled report configurations are listed here, each showing the store, sections, recurrence frequency, and delivery status.

![Vortex Mind Scheduled Reports list showing active report schedules with their store, sections, recurrence frequency, and delivery configuration](<../aios screenshots/vortex mind - view reports- scheduled reports.png>)

*The Scheduled Reports list: active report schedules showing the store analysed, intelligence sections included, recurrence frequency, and delivery configuration for each automated briefing.*

To create a new schedule:
1. Click **Create Schedule** from the Scheduled Reports screen.
2. Configure the **store**, **report sections**, **date range logic** (e.g., previous 7 days, previous calendar month), and **delivery frequency** (daily, weekly, monthly).
3. Save the schedule — Vortex Mind will generate and deliver the report automatically at the configured interval, adding each new report to your View Reports history.

![Create Schedule form for Vortex Mind automated reports showing store selector, section choices, date range logic, and frequency configuration](<../aios screenshots/vortex mind - view reports- scheduled reports-create schedule.png>)

*The Create Schedule form: configure the store, intelligence sections, date range logic, and delivery frequency to fully automate your recurring reporting and briefing workflow.*

## Extended Intelligence Capabilities

Vortex Mind's architecture supports an expanding set of strategic intelligence features. The following capabilities are part of the platform's intelligence roadmap and are enabled by the same underlying infrastructure that powers the core report engine:

**Executive Summaries:**
A high-level business briefing — wins, risks, and recommended focus areas — delivered as a concise summary designed for senior leadership consumption. Combines KPI highlights, product signals, and the top three recommended actions into a single, scannable document.

**Competitor Intelligence:**
Proactive alerts when competitive signals change in your category — price movements, new product launches, or shifts in promotional strategy — so your team can respond before the impact reaches your own metrics.

**Podcast Briefings:**
For busy eCommerce leaders, the Podcast section generates a downloadable audio summary of the full intelligence document. Listen during your commute or between meetings and stay fully briefed without reading a report.

!!! tip "Podcast Reports Are Available Now"
    The **Podcast** section is available today as a selectable option in the Generate Report configuration screen. Include it in any report to receive a downloadable audio version of your intelligence briefing alongside the full written document.

## AI Safety & Guardrails

Vortex Mind operates as a read-only intelligence layer. It analyses, summarises, and recommends — it does not modify your store data, publishing settings, or campaign configurations without your explicit instruction.

**Human-in-the-Loop Design:**
When Vortex Mind surfaces a Strategic Recommendation that involves a specific action, it presents the recommendation as a proposal with supporting data. Acting on that recommendation requires navigating to the relevant agent or explicitly initiating the action within the appropriate workflow. No automated changes occur from the intelligence layer alone.

**Data Scope:**
All reports are generated exclusively from data you have linked to your workspace through **Settings → Connected Sources**. Vortex Mind cannot access data from platforms that are not actively connected to your account.

**Access Control:**
Report generation and schedule management are available to users with Manager or Administrator privileges. Users with the Viewer role can read and download existing reports but cannot generate new ones or create or modify scheduled report configurations.

**Audit Trail:**
Report generation events — including which store was analysed, which sections were included, who triggered the report, and when it was delivered — are logged in your [Audit Trail](governance/audit-trails.md).

!!! note "Coverage Note"
    The Competitive Analysis section of Vortex Mind reports is based on industry benchmark data available through your connected platforms. Live competitor price-change alerts and real-time competitive signal monitoring are part of the Vortex Mind intelligence roadmap.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How is Vortex Mind different from Ask Viq?**
Ask Viq is reactive — it answers your questions on demand in a conversational interface. Vortex Mind is proactive — it generates comprehensive, structured intelligence reports across multiple sections of your business, either on demand or on an automated schedule. The two are complementary: Ask Viq is your analyst on call; Vortex Mind is your scheduled strategic briefing.

**Q: Can I schedule reports to deliver automatically?**
Yes. The Scheduled Reports feature within Vortex Mind lets you configure daily, weekly, or monthly report delivery. Each schedule specifies which store to analyse, which sections to include, and what date range logic to apply. Reports are generated automatically and added to your View Reports history at the configured interval.

**Q: Does Vortex Mind support multiple stores in the same report?**
Each report is scoped to a single connected store. If you manage multiple storefronts, you can create separate report configurations — or separate schedules — for each. Partner Account users can access Vortex Mind independently for each client workspace using the workspace switcher.

**Q: What is the Podcast section in a Vortex Mind report?**
When you include the Podcast section in your report configuration, Vortex Mind generates a downloadable audio summary of the full intelligence briefing alongside the written document. This allows you or your leadership team to consume the report as an audio briefing — useful for remote teams, commuting, or situations where a full document review is not practical.

**Q: How far back can I run a Vortex Mind report?**
The date range is configurable at the time of report generation. Historical data availability depends on how long your connected platforms have been linked to your workspace. Platforms connected during onboarding will have data from that date forward; the full historical range available within each platform's own data retention limits applies.
