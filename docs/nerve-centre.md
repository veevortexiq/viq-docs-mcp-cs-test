# Nerve Centre

**Nerve Centre is the real-time monitoring layer of the Vortex IQ AI OS. It connects to every platform in your eCommerce stack — storefronts, advertising, payments, analytics, and site health — and monitors them continuously. When a metric deviates from its expected pattern, Nerve Centre detects it instantly and delivers automated alerts to your team, so you can act before the problem reaches your customers.**

## Why Real-Time Monitoring Is Non-Negotiable

For eCommerce operators, the difference between catching a checkout error in two minutes and two hours is not inconvenient — it is catastrophically expensive. The average cost of one hour of website downtime for mid-size and large businesses exceeds **$300,000**, and **36% of eCommerce businesses reported a site outage in the last year** — each outage eroding both revenue and customer trust (Source: [Information Technology Intelligence Consulting, cited by Lagnis — True Cost of Website Downtime 2025](https://lagnis.com/blog/true-cost-website-downtime-ecommerce-2025/)). The damage is not limited to the incident itself: **79% of customers who experience a website issue are less likely to buy from that site again** (Source: Akamai Research, via [SafetyBis — Ecommerce Prevention Strategies](https://www.safetybis.com/blog/ecommerce-prevention-strategies/)).

Yet most eCommerce teams still rely on manual checks, delayed reports, or customer complaints to discover problems. By the time a human notices a conversion rate collapse or a payment gateway failure, thousands of transactions have already been lost.

Nerve Centre changes the equation by monitoring every connected platform continuously and surfacing anomalies the moment they appear. Teams that implement real-time monitoring solutions report a **90–99% reduction in undetected downtime incidents**, transforming reactive firefighting into proactive situational awareness (Source: [Lagnis — True Cost of Website Downtime 2025](https://lagnis.com/blog/true-cost-website-downtime-ecommerce-2025/)). By 2026, **60% of enterprises are projected to implement AI-driven anomaly detection and outage prediction systems** — recognising real-time intelligence as a competitive requirement, not a luxury (Source: Industry AI adoption research).

## Step-by-Step: Using the Nerve Centre

### Step 1: Open the Nerve Centre

Click **Nerve Centre** in the left-hand navigation sidebar. The Nerve Centre home screen loads with the Signals sidebar visible on the left, displaying all your connected platform monitors. Select any platform signal to load its KPI dashboard in the main workspace.

### Step 2: Read Your KPI Dashboards

Each platform displays a structured KPI dashboard with two primary components:

**KPI Snapshot Cards** at the top of the screen show your headline metrics for the current period — total orders, revenue, discounts applied, and other top-line figures — providing an instant at-a-glance view of your store's health.

**Metrics & Historical Analysis Table** below the cards breaks each individual metric down across three time horizons — 7-day, 30-day, and 12-month — with Average and Total figures for each period. This multi-horizon view makes it possible to distinguish a temporary spike from a persistent trend at a glance.

**Shopify KPI Dashboard:**

### Step 3: Set Up a Monitor

A monitor is a scheduled watch on a specific metric. When the metric crosses the threshold you define, the monitor fires — logging the event and triggering the alert configuration attached to it.

To create a monitor:

1. Navigate to the platform signal you want to monitor from the Signals sidebar.
2. Locate the specific metric in the Metrics & Historical Analysis table.
3. Click **+ Set Alert** on the far right of that metric row.
4. Configure your monitor:
   - **Monitor Name** — a descriptive label for this watch rule (e.g., "Shopify Revenue Drop Alert").
   - **Schedule** — how frequently the monitor checks for changes (e.g., every hour, every day).
   - **Trigger Parameters** — the specific conditions that activate the monitor (e.g., revenue drops below a defined threshold).
5. Save the monitor — it becomes active immediately and begins checking on the configured schedule.

### Step 4: Configure an Alert

An alert configuration defines what happens when a monitor fires. For each monitor, you can configure:

- **Alert Rule** — the specific metric, operator (greater than, less than, equals), and threshold value that defines the alert condition.
- **Notification Channel** — where the alert is delivered: Email, Slack, or Microsoft Teams.
- **Notification Condition** — when to send: on every trigger, on failure only, or on success only.
- **Notification Interval** — the minimum time between repeated alert notifications for the same sustained condition (to prevent alert fatigue).
- **Priority** — how urgently this alert should be flagged in the Unified Alerts Dashboard (standard or critical).

### Step 5: Monitor the Unified Alerts Dashboard

The **Unified Alerts Dashboard** gives you a single screen showing all alert activity across every connected platform. The top of the screen displays four live summary counters:

- **Active Alerts** — monitors currently detecting a condition that meets your alert threshold.
- **Triggered Today** — the total number of alert events fired in the last 24 hours.
- **Critical Issues** — high-priority alerts requiring immediate attention.
- **Paused Alerts** — monitors that have been temporarily suspended.

Filter the alert list by platform, status, priority, or keyword to find and action the alerts most relevant to your current focus area.

## Extended Monitoring Capabilities

Nerve Centre's module catalogue spans the full eCommerce operational stack. The following capabilities are available across subscription plans:

**Budget Pacing:** Catch advertising overspend before the end of the day — monitors your ad budgets in real time and alerts you the moment pacing suggests you will exceed your daily limit.

**ROAS Alerts:** Return on ad spend monitoring across all connected advertising platforms, with threshold-based alerts that fire the moment efficiency drops below your target.

**Conversion Drop Detection:** Monitors conversion rate changes and delivers instant notifications the moment a sustained drop is detected — allowing you to investigate and respond before the entire session cohort abandons the purchase.

**Traffic Spike & Drop Monitoring:** Detects sudden changes in website traffic patterns — both unexplained spikes (potential bot traffic or viral events) and drops (potential outages or indexing issues).

**Campaign Underperformance:** Anomaly detection across your advertising platforms that identifies weak campaigns early, before significant budget is wasted on ineffective spend.

**Speed & Uptime Monitoring:** Uptime and load speed monitoring for your homepage and specific pages — detects and alerts on availability failures within minutes of occurrence.

!!! note "Monitoring Coverage Note"
    The monitors available in your Nerve Centre depend on the platforms you have connected through **Settings → Connected Sources** and the modules included in your subscription plan. Each monitoring module is enabled individually — you can activate only the signals relevant to your operations.

## AI Safety & Guardrails

The Nerve Centre is a read-only intelligence layer. It observes, detects, and alerts — it does not modify your store, campaigns, or data autonomously.

**Human-in-the-Loop by Design:**
When Nerve Centre detects an anomaly that warrants action, it surfaces the alert for human review. Acting on an alert — such as pausing a campaign, reducing a discount, or escalating to a development team — requires navigating to the relevant tool or explicitly initiating the action. No automated change is made to your live store or campaigns from the monitoring layer alone.

**Monitor Lifecycle Control:**
You can pause, resume, or delete any monitor at any time from the Nerve Centre interface. Pausing a monitor suspends its scheduled checks without deleting its configuration — useful for planned maintenance windows or promotional periods where standard thresholds don't apply.

**Notification Interval Protection:**
The notification interval setting on each alert configuration prevents alert storms — ensuring your team is not overwhelmed by repeated notifications for the same sustained condition.

**Access Control:**
Monitor creation and alert configuration require Manager or Administrator privileges. Users with the Viewer role can view KPI dashboards and alert history but cannot create, modify, or delete monitors or alert configurations.

**Audit Trail:**
Every monitor creation, alert configuration change, and alert trigger event is logged in your [Audit Trail](governance/audit-trails.md) with the platform, metric, threshold, and the identity of the user who made the change.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What is the difference between a Monitor and an Alert Configuration in the Nerve Centre?**
A monitor is the scheduled watch that checks a specific metric at your defined interval — it detects when a condition has occurred. An alert configuration is the notification rule attached to that monitor — it defines who gets notified, through which channel, and under what conditions when the monitor fires. You can have multiple alert configurations on a single monitor, each with different thresholds and notification channels.

**Q: How quickly does the Nerve Centre detect a metric change?**
Detection speed depends on the monitoring schedule configured for each monitor. Monitors can be set to check as frequently as every few minutes or as infrequently as daily. For critical metrics such as payment gateway success rates or site uptime, shorter intervals are recommended to minimise the gap between an incident occurring and your team being notified.

**Q: Can I monitor the same metric with different thresholds for different alert priorities?**
Yes. You can create multiple alert configurations on the same monitor with different threshold values and different priority levels. For example, a revenue drop below 20% might trigger a standard-priority alert; a drop below 40% might trigger a critical-priority alert. Each configuration can also route to a different notification channel.

**Q: What happens to alerts when I pause a monitor?**
Pausing a monitor suspends its scheduled checks immediately. No new alert events are triggered during the pause period. When you resume the monitor, it resumes checking on the configured schedule from that point forward — it does not retroactively evaluate data from the paused period.

**Q: Does the Core Web Vitals monitor track both lab data and real-user data?**
Yes. The Core Web Vitals monitoring module uses both Google PageSpeed Insights (lab data from controlled test conditions) and the Google Chrome UX Report (CrUX — real-user field data captured from actual visitor sessions on your site). CrUX data reflects the actual performance experience of your real visitors and is the signal Google uses for search ranking assessments.
