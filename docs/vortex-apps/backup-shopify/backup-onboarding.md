# Backup Onboarding

Thank you for choosing the [Vortex Backup](index.md) app! We’re excited to have you on board. Let us take you on a quick tour to help you get familiar, settle in, and make the most of the app’s features available under your selected license plan.

## App Installation

Refer to the **[Setup](backup-setup.md)** page to install the App from the Shopify App Marketplace.

**Once the app is installed and subscribed, it will automatically begin backing up all the key data entities. Please allow some time for this initial backup to complete before starting to use the app.**

> **Note:** Data entities are backed up immediately after installation, which require regular manual backups, and which support real-time backup

You’ll notice that the sync status is set to **Active**, and the status of all data entities will also display as <u>Active</u>.

## Understanding the App Interfaces

Refer the article - **[Understanding the Vortex Backup App Pages](app-pages/index.md)**

## Time Taken for Data Backups

This is based on many factors such as the data available in your tenant, the data dependencies, BigCommerce API throttling, transfer connections speeds etc. and can range from a few seconds for simple backups to several hours for data intensive backups
