# Frequently Asked Questions

<p>Common questions about BigCommerce product migration.</p><hr /><h2>General Questions</h2><h3>What happens to my original store data?</h3><p>Your source store data is <strong>never modified or deleted</strong>. The migration only reads data from your source store and creates copies in the destination store. Your source products remain exactly as they are.</p><h3>How long does a migration take?</h3><p>Migration time depends on your product complexity and catalog size:</p><table><thead><tr><th><p>Product Type</p></th><th><p>Approximate Time</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Simple product (no variants)</p></td><td><p>5-15 seconds</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Product with variants</p></td><td><p>15-30 seconds</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Complex product (modifiers, custom fields, reviews)</p></td><td><p>30-60 seconds</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Product with locale data</p></td><td><p>1-2 minutes</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>For bulk migrations:</p><table><thead><tr><th><p>Catalog Size</p></th><th><p>Approximate Time</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>10 products</p></td><td><p>5-15 minutes</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>100 products</p></td><td><p>30-60 minutes</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>500 products</p></td><td><p>2-4 hours</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>1,000+ products</p></td><td><p>Several hours</p></td></tr></tbody></table><blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> Products with many images or variants take longer.</p></blockquote><h3>Can I migrate multiple times?</h3><p>Yes! The platform uses duplicate detection—if a product already exists in the destination (matched by name or SKU), it's updated rather than duplicated. This means you can safely run migrations multiple times without creating duplicate products.</p><h3>What if my migration fails partway through?</h3><ul><li><p>Already-migrated products remain in the destination store</p></li><li><p>The failed product can be retried individually</p></li><li><p>Detailed error information helps identify the issue</p></li><li><p>If updating an existing product, you can trigger a rollback to restore the original data</p></li></ul><h3>Can I rollback a migration?</h3><p>Yes, for products that were <strong>updated</strong> (not newly created): - A backup is created before any changes - You can restore the product to its pre-migration state - Rollback restores: product base, options, variants, modifiers, custom fields, bulk pricing, and videos - Images are NOT rolled back (they're only added, never deleted)</p><hr /><h2>Component Cleanup (UPDATE Mode)</h2><h3>What happens to existing product data when updating?</h3><p>When a product already exists in the destination store (matched by name or SKU), the migration operates in <strong>UPDATE mode</strong>. This involves a <strong>complete cleanup</strong> of existing components before recreating them from the source.</p><h3>Why does the platform delete existing components?</h3><p>This ensures: - <strong>Clean slate</strong>: No orphaned or duplicate data - <strong>Accurate transfer</strong>: Source becomes single source of truth - <strong>Correct mappings</strong>: New IDs are properly linked (options to variants, modifiers to complex rules) - <strong>No conflicts</strong>: Prevents ID mismatches between old and new data</p><h3>What gets deleted in UPDATE mode?</h3><table><thead><tr><th><p>Component</p></th><th><p>What Happens</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Images</p></td><td><p>ALL existing images deleted, then source images uploaded</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Options</p></td><td><p>ALL options deleted (variants auto-delete with them)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Variants</p></td><td><p>Deleted when options are removed, then recreated</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Modifiers</p></td><td><p>ALL modifiers deleted, then recreated from source</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Custom Fields</p></td><td><p>ALL custom fields deleted, then recreated</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Bulk Pricing Rules</p></td><td><p>ALL rules deleted, then recreated</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Videos</p></td><td><p>ALL videos deleted, then recreated</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>What about complex rules during cleanup?</h3><p>Complex rules are handled intelligently: - <strong>Matching rules</strong>: If a rule in destination matches source, it's preserved - <strong>Auto-generated rules</strong>: Single-condition rules (auto-created by BigCommerce) are cleaned up - <strong>Non-matching rules</strong>: Created fresh from source</p><h3>Is my data backed up before deletion?</h3><p>Yes! Before any deletion occurs: 1. Complete backup is created 2. Includes: product base, options, variants, modifiers, custom fields, bulk pricing, videos 3. Backup retained for rollback capability</p><h3>Can I prevent the cleanup?</h3><p>No. The cleanup is essential for accurate migration. However: - <strong>Backup protects you</strong>: Rollback available if needed - <strong>CREATE mode</strong>: If product doesn't exist, no cleanup needed - <strong>Test first</strong>: Migrate a sample product to verify results</p><h3>What if I only want to update some fields?</h3><p>Currently, migration is all-or-nothing for components. If you need selective updates: 1. Export the product data you want to preserve 2. Run the migration 3. Manually restore specific fields if needed</p><blockquote><p><strong>Tip:</strong> For partial updates, consider using BigCommerce's native import/export tools instead.</p></blockquote><hr /><h2>Products &amp; Catalog</h2><h3>Will my product images transfer?</h3><p>Yes. Product images are downloaded from your source store and re-uploaded to the destination store. This ensures: - Images are properly hosted in your new store - All image URLs work correctly - Alt text and display order are preserved</p><h3>How is inventory handled?</h3><p>Inventory levels are transferred directly: - Product-level inventory for simple products - Variant-level inventory for products with options - Inventory warning levels are preserved - Inventory tracking settings (none, product, variant) are maintained</p><h3>What about products in multiple categories?</h3><p>Product category assignments are fully preserved: - All category assignments transfer - Category hierarchy is recreated in the destination - If a category doesn't exist, it's created with the full parent path</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><pre><code>Product in: Electronics &gt; Computers &gt; Laptops
All three categories created if needed, product assigned to "Laptops"
</code></pre><h3>Are product metafields migrated?</h3><p>Yes, both <strong>custom fields</strong> and <strong>metafields</strong> are migrated:</p><p><strong>Custom Fields</strong> (displayed on storefront): - Field names and values preserved - Display order maintained</p><p><strong>Metafields</strong> (key-value metadata): - Product metafields fully migrated - Variant metafields migrated to corresponding variants - Category metafields migrated when categories are created - Namespace and permission settings preserved</p><blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> App-specific metafields may require the same app installed in destination to be fully functional.</p></blockquote><h3>What happens to SEO data?</h3><p>All SEO data transfers directly to help preserve your search engine rankings: - Page title - Meta description - Search keywords - Custom URL path</p><hr /><h2>Variants &amp; Options</h2><h3>How are option values mapped?</h3><p>When options are created in the destination store, BigCommerce assigns new IDs. The migration platform:</p><ol><li><p>Creates options in the destination (e.g., "Size" with values Small, Medium, Large)</p></li><li><p>Records the mapping: Source ID → Destination ID</p></li><li><p>Uses this mapping when creating variants</p></li></ol><p>This ensures variants are correctly linked to their options.</p><h3>What if a variant's SKU already exists?</h3><p>If you're creating a new product: - All variants are created with their original SKUs - If a SKU conflict exists with another product, the variant creation may fail</p><p>If you're updating an existing product: - Old variants are deleted first - New variants are created with source SKUs</p><h3>Are variant images preserved?</h3><p>Yes. Each variant can have its own image: - Variant-specific images are migrated - Images are linked to the correct variant after migration - Main product images are also preserved</p><h3>What about option display types?</h3><p>All option types are preserved:</p><table><thead><tr><th><p>Type</p></th><th><p>Migrated</p></th><th><p>Notes</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Dropdown</p></td><td><p>Yes</p></td><td><p>Standard dropdown menu</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Radio Buttons</p></td><td><p>Yes</p></td><td><p>Radio button selection</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Rectangles</p></td><td><p>Yes</p></td><td><p>Rectangle/button selector</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Swatch</p></td><td><p>Yes</p></td><td><p>Color swatches with hex codes</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Product List</p></td><td><p>Yes</p></td><td><p>Product selection options</p></td></tr></tbody></table><hr /><h2>Pricing &amp; Inventory</h2><h3>Is pricing data preserved exactly?</h3><p>Yes, all pricing fields transfer exactly as configured: - Base price - Sale price - Cost price (your cost, hidden from customers) - Retail price (MSRP) - Variant-specific pricing overrides</p><h3>How does bulk pricing work after migration?</h3><p>Bulk pricing rules transfer completely: - All quantity tiers preserved - Discount types (percent off, fixed amount, set price) maintained - Rules apply immediately in the destination store</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><pre><code>Buy 10-24: 10% off
Buy 25-49: 15% off
Buy 50+: 20% off
</code></pre><p>All three rules migrate and work immediately.</p><h3>What about inventory levels?</h3><p>Inventory is copied at the time of migration: - Current stock levels transfer - Inventory warning thresholds transfer - Tracking settings (none, product, variant) preserved</p><blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> Inventory is a snapshot—changes in the source store after migration won't automatically sync.</p></blockquote><hr /><h2>Modifiers &amp; Custom Fields</h2><h3>Are product modifiers migrated?</h3><p>Yes, all modifier types are fully supported:</p><table><thead><tr><th><p>Modifier Type</p></th><th><p>Migrated</p></th><th><p>Notes</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Text Field</p></td><td><p>Yes</p></td><td><p>Single-line text input</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Multi-Line Text</p></td><td><p>Yes</p></td><td><p>Text area</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Numbers Only</p></td><td><p>Yes</p></td><td><p>Numeric input</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Checkbox</p></td><td><p>Yes</p></td><td><p>Yes/no option</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Date Field</p></td><td><p>Yes</p></td><td><p>Date picker</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>File Upload</p></td><td><p>Yes</p></td><td><p>Customer file uploads</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Dropdown</p></td><td><p>Yes</p></td><td><p>Selection menu</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Radio Buttons</p></td><td><p>Yes</p></td><td><p>Radio selection</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Rectangles</p></td><td><p>Yes</p></td><td><p>Button selection</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Swatch</p></td><td><p>Yes</p></td><td><p>Color selection</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Product List</p></td><td><p>Yes</p></td><td><p>Product selection</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Do modifier price adjustments work?</h3><p>Yes. Price and weight adjustments on modifier values transfer exactly: - Checkbox that adds $10 → Works in destination - Dropdown with different prices per option → All prices preserved</p><h3>What about custom fields?</h3><p>All custom fields migrate: - Field names preserved - Field values preserved - Display order maintained</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><pre><code>Material: 100% Cotton
Care: Machine wash cold
Made In: USA
</code></pre><p>All three fields appear on the destination product.</p><hr /><h2>Complex Rules</h2><h3>What are complex rules?</h3><p>Complex rules are conditional logic rules that trigger actions based on modifier selections. They can: - Adjust price when certain modifier combinations are selected - Adjust weight for shipping calculations - Disable purchasing for certain combinations - Display different images based on selections</p><h3>Are complex rules migrated?</h3><p>Yes! Complex rules are fully migrated with: - All conditions (modifier + value combinations) - Price adjusters (percent, fixed amount, or absolute) - Weight adjusters - Purchasing disabled flags and messages - Enabled/stop flags</p><h3>How are modifier IDs handled in complex rules?</h3><p>The platform automatically maps modifier IDs: 1. Modifiers are created first in destination 2. Source-to-destination ID mapping is captured 3. Complex rules are updated with new modifier IDs 4. Modifier value IDs are also mapped correctly</p><h3>What if a complex rule references a modifier that wasn't migrated?</h3><p>If a modifier ID in a rule can't be mapped: - A warning is logged - The rule may not function correctly - Check that all modifiers were successfully migrated</p><h3>Do complex rules work immediately after migration?</h3><p>Yes. Once migration completes: - Rules are active in destination - Price/weight adjustments apply on product pages - Purchasing restrictions are enforced</p><h3>What about auto-generated complex rules?</h3><p>BigCommerce auto-generates simple complex rules for modifiers with price adjustments. During migration: - <strong>Matching auto-generated rules</strong>: Preserved (not duplicated) - <strong>Redundant auto-generated rules</strong>: Cleaned up to avoid conflicts - <strong>Custom multi-condition rules</strong>: Created fresh from source</p><h3>Can I test complex rules after migration?</h3><p>Yes! To verify complex rules work correctly: 1. Go to product page in destination store 2. Select modifier combinations that should trigger rules 3. Verify price/weight changes in cart 4. Test purchasing restrictions if applicable</p><hr /><h2>Metafields</h2><h3>What's the difference between custom fields and metafields?</h3><table><thead><tr><th><p>Feature</p></th><th><p>Custom Fields</p></th><th><p>Metafields</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Display</p></td><td><p>Shown on storefront</p></td><td><p>Hidden by default</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Structure</p></td><td><p>Name + Value</p></td><td><p>Namespace + Key + Value</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Purpose</p></td><td><p>Customer-facing info</p></td><td><p>App/integration data</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Visibility</p></td><td><p>Always visible</p></td><td><p>Controlled by permission</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Are all metafield types supported?</h3><p>Yes, all metafield value types are supported: - String - Integer - Decimal - Date/DateTime - JSON - URL</p><h3>What about metafield permissions?</h3><p>Permission settings are preserved:</p><table><thead><tr><th><p>Permission</p></th><th><p>Behavior</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>app_only</p></td><td><p>Only visible to creating app</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>read</p></td><td><p>Visible via API</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>write</p></td><td><p>Modifiable via API</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>read<em>and</em>sf_access</p></td><td><p>Visible on storefront</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Are variant metafields migrated?</h3><p>Yes. Variant metafields are: 1. Fetched from source variants 2. Mapped to corresponding destination variants (via SKU/option matching) 3. Created on the new variants</p><h3>What about category metafields?</h3><p>When a category is created during migration, its metafields are also migrated: - Existing category metafields in destination are replaced - Source metafields are created on destination category</p><hr /><h2>Reviews</h2><h3>Are product reviews migrated?</h3><p>Yes, customer reviews are fully migrated: - Review title and content - Star rating (1-5) - Reviewer name and email - Original review date - Review status (approved, pending, disapproved)</p><h3>Do review ratings calculate correctly?</h3><p>Yes. After migration: - All reviews are attached to the destination product - Average rating is calculated from migrated reviews - Review count reflects total migrated reviews</p><h3>Can I migrate reviews selectively?</h3><p>Reviews are migrated as part of the product. If you migrate a product, its reviews come along. You cannot currently migrate only reviews without the product.</p><hr /><h2>Localization (Multi-Language)</h2><h3>Are multi-language products supported?</h3><p>Yes! The platform migrates locale-specific data across 10 categories:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Basic Information</strong> - Translated name and description</p></li><li><p><strong>SEO</strong> - Locale-specific page title and meta description</p></li><li><p><strong>URL</strong> - Custom URL path per locale</p></li><li><p><strong>Options</strong> - Translated option names and values</p></li><li><p><strong>Modifiers</strong> - Translated modifier names and values</p></li><li><p><strong>Custom Fields</strong> - Translated field names and values</p></li><li><p><strong>Images</strong> - Locale-specific alt text and visibility</p></li><li><p><strong>Pre-Order</strong> - Translated pre-order messages</p></li><li><p><strong>Storefront</strong> - Warranty, availability, search keywords</p></li><li><p><strong>Channel Overrides</strong> - Featured status per channel</p></li></ol><h3>What locale data gets migrated?</h3><p>For each locale configured in your source store: - All text content that has locale-specific overrides - Locale-specific URL paths for SEO - Option and modifier label translations - Image alt text translations</p><h3>Do I need to set up locales in the destination first?</h3><p>Locale configuration should be set up in your destination store's settings. The migration transfers the locale-specific content, but your store must be configured to display those locales.</p><hr /><h2>Brands &amp; Categories</h2><h3>How are brands handled?</h3><p>Brands are matched by name: 1. Source product has brand "AudioTech" 2. Platform searches destination for "AudioTech" 3. If found: Uses existing brand 4. If not found: Creates new brand</p><h3>What about category hierarchy?</h3><p>Categories are recreated with full hierarchy:</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><pre><code>Source category path: Electronics &gt; Audio &gt; Headphones

Migration creates (if needed):
1. "Electronics" (top level)
2. "Audio" (child of Electronics)
3. "Headphones" (child of Audio)

Product assigned to "Headphones"
</code></pre><h3>Are category descriptions migrated?</h3><p>When a category is created, only the essential information is migrated: - Category name - Parent relationship</p><p>Category descriptions, images, and SEO data are not part of product migration. For full category migration, a separate process would be needed.</p><hr /><h2>Widget Templates &amp; Custom Templates</h2><h3>What are widget templates?</h3><p>Widget templates control how product page widgets appear. If your source product uses custom widgets, the template definitions are migrated to ensure the destination product displays correctly.</p><h3>What about custom page templates?</h3><p>If your source product uses a custom page template (e.g., <code>product-special.html</code>), the association is recreated in the destination.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Important:</strong> The template file itself must exist in your destination theme. Only the association is migrated, not the template file.</p></blockquote><hr /><h2>Same-Store Channel Migration (Multi-Storefront)</h2><h3>What happens when source and destination stores are the same?</h3><p>When you migrate between channels in the <strong>same store</strong>, the platform automatically uses a <strong>simplified channel migration workflow</strong>. This is detected when: - Source store ID = Destination store ID - Source channel ID ≠ Destination channel ID</p><p>In this mode, only <strong>channel-specific content</strong> is migrated because the product already exists.</p><h3>Why aren't product components migrated in channel migration?</h3><p>In same-store channel migration: - The product already exists in the store - Options, variants, modifiers, etc. are <strong>store-level</strong> data, not channel-specific - Only channel-specific data needs to be set up for the new channel</p><p><strong>What IS migrated:</strong> - Category assignments (to destination channel's tree) - Channel assignment (makes product visible) - Widget templates - Custom template associations - Locale data for the destination channel</p><p><strong>What is NOT migrated:</strong> - Product base data (already exists) - Options and variants (store-level) - Modifiers and complex rules (store-level) - Images and videos (store-level) - Custom fields, bulk pricing, reviews (store-level)</p><h3>Can I rollback a channel migration?</h3><p>No, channel migration does not include backup/rollback because: - <strong>Nothing is deleted</strong>: Original product data unchanged - <strong>Non-destructive</strong>: Only adds visibility to new channel - <strong>Reversible manually</strong>: Remove channel assignment via BigCommerce admin</p><p>To "undo" a channel migration: 1. Go to BigCommerce admin 2. Edit the product 3. Remove the channel assignment for the destination channel</p><h3>How fast is channel migration compared to full migration?</h3><p>Channel migration is significantly faster:</p><table><thead><tr><th><p>Product Type</p></th><th><p>Full Migration</p></th><th><p>Channel Migration</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Simple product</p></td><td><p>5-15 seconds</p></td><td><p>2-5 seconds</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>With locale data</p></td><td><p>1-2 minutes</p></td><td><p>15-30 seconds</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Complex product</p></td><td><p>30-60 seconds</p></td><td><p>5-10 seconds</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Will channel migration create a duplicate product?</h3><p>No. Channel migration uses the <strong>same product ID</strong>. The product is simply made visible on an additional channel. You end up with one product visible on multiple channels, not multiple products.</p><h3>Can I migrate to multiple channels at once?</h3><p>Currently, you migrate to one destination channel per request. To publish a product to multiple channels: 1. Run channel migration for Channel A 2. Run channel migration for Channel B 3. And so on...</p><p>Each migration is fast, so publishing to multiple channels takes minimal time.</p><h3>What about channel-specific pricing?</h3><p>Channel migration does not change pricing. If you need different prices per channel: 1. First, run the channel migration to make the product visible 2. Then, use BigCommerce's channel-specific pricing features to set prices per channel</p><h3>Does locale data differ between channels?</h3><p>Yes! Each channel can have its own locale-specific content. During channel migration, locale data from the source channel is copied to the destination channel. After migration, you can customize locale content per channel.</p><hr /><h2>Troubleshooting</h2><h3>"Product already exists" - is this an error?</h3><p>No! This is expected behavior. It means: - A product with the same name or SKU was found in the destination - The platform will UPDATE this product instead of creating a duplicate - This prevents duplicate products in your catalog</p><blockquote><p><strong>Important:</strong> UPDATE mode will delete and replace existing components. See <a href="#component-cleanup-update-mode">Component Cleanup</a> for details.</p></blockquote><h3>Some product images didn't migrate - why?</h3><p>Common reasons: - <strong>Source image unavailable</strong>: The image URL might be broken or inaccessible - <strong>Image too large</strong>: Very large images may timeout during download - <strong>Format issues</strong>: Some image formats may not be supported</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Check the source product images are accessible and retry the migration.</p><h3>My variants aren't showing the right options</h3><p>This usually indicates an option mapping issue. Possible causes: - Options were modified in the destination after migration - Source product had inconsistent option values</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Re-migrate the product to refresh the option mappings.</p><h3>Modifiers aren't showing price adjustments</h3><p>Verify that: 1. The source product had price adjustments configured 2. The modifier type supports price adjustments (some don't) 3. The adjustment values weren't zero</p><h3>Complex rules not working after migration</h3><p>Check the following: 1. <strong>Modifiers migrated</strong>: Complex rules depend on modifiers existing first 2. <strong>ID mapping</strong>: If modifier migration failed, rule conditions may reference invalid IDs 3. <strong>Rule enabled</strong>: Verify the rule's "enabled" flag is true 4. <strong>Conditions met</strong>: Test the exact modifier combination that should trigger the rule</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Re-migrate the product to ensure modifiers and rules are properly linked.</p><h3>Product not appearing on storefront</h3><p>Check these settings: - <strong>Is Visible</strong>: Product visibility flag - <strong>Channel Assignment</strong>: Product must be assigned to the storefront channel - <strong>Category</strong>: Product should be in a visible category - <strong>Inventory</strong>: If tracking is enabled, verify stock quantity</p><h3>Custom fields not displaying</h3><p>Custom fields may not display automatically. Verify: 1. Custom fields were migrated (check product in admin) 2. Your theme is configured to display custom fields 3. The field names match what your theme expects</p><h3>I lost data after updating a product - can I recover it?</h3><p>If a product was updated (not created), a backup was taken: 1. Use the rollback feature with the migration ID 2. Original product data will be restored 3. Components restored: base data, options, variants, modifiers, custom fields, bulk pricing, videos</p><blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> Images and reviews are NOT rolled back (they're only added, never deleted).</p></blockquote><h3>Why are my destination product variants all gone?</h3><p>In UPDATE mode, all options are deleted before migration, which automatically deletes all variants. This is expected behavior: - Variants are recreated from source - Inventory levels from source are applied - Option value mappings are fresh</p><p>If source had fewer variants than destination, only source variants will exist after migration.</p><h3>Metafields from apps aren't working</h3><p>App-specific metafields may require: 1. Same app installed in destination store 2. App to have matching client ID 3. Proper permission settings</p><p>If the creating app isn't installed, metafields exist but may not function as expected.</p><hr /><h2>Best Practices</h2><h3>Before Migration</h3><ol><li><p><strong>Verify source data</strong>: Ensure products have complete data</p></li><li><p><strong>Check images</strong>: Confirm all image URLs are accessible</p></li><li><p><strong>Review inventory</strong>: Know your current stock levels</p></li><li><p><strong>Document custom templates</strong>: Note which templates your products use</p></li></ol><h3>During Migration</h3><ol><li><p><strong>Start small</strong>: Test with a few products first</p></li><li><p><strong>Monitor progress</strong>: Check migration status regularly</p></li><li><p><strong>Review results</strong>: Verify migrated products look correct</p></li></ol><h3>After Migration</h3><ol><li><p><strong>Spot check products</strong>: Review several products in detail</p></li><li><p><strong>Test purchasing</strong>: Add products to cart, check pricing</p></li><li><p><strong>Verify images</strong>: Confirm all images display correctly</p></li><li><p><strong>Check variants</strong>: Test option selection and variant switching</p></li><li><p><strong>Review SEO</strong>: Confirm page titles and meta descriptions</p></li></ol><hr /><h2>Still Have Questions?</h2><p>When contacting support, please provide: - Source and destination store identifiers - Product IDs you're trying to migrate - Any error messages you've encountered - Screenshots if applicable</p><p>We're here to help ensure a smooth migration!</p><hr />
