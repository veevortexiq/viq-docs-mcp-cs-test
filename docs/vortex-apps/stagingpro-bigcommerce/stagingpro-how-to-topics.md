### Q. How to migrate products from v2 to v3 store using StagingPro? {#v2-v3}

For customers seeking to move from V2 to V3, a high level outline of the steps followed, are listed below:

1.	A V3 Sandbox is created and linked to the merchants existing V2 Production store

2.	Using StagingPro, copy product data from V2 Production to the V3 Sandbox store

3.	Review and fix all issues on the V3 Sandbox store

4.	After all issues are fixed, request BigCommerce support to upgrade your existing V2 production store to V3 and delete old products there (maintenance page recommended before migration begins)

5.	Use StagingPro to push data (including Products, Brands and Categories) from the V3 Sandbox to the revised V3 Production store
Note: If using any ERP or other downstream system that uses Product ID instead of SKUs, update the new Product IDs (although SKUs will remain same).

6.	Finally after migration is complete, remove maintenance page and your revised V3 Production store is ready
