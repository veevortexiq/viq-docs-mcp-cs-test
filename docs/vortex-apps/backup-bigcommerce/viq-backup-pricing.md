### **Additional Information:**

- **Plan pricing** automatically adjusts based on the monthly order volume.
- **Maximum billing cap:** $499 per month, regardless of order volume. Send email to [**sales@vortexiq.ai**](mailto:sales@vortexiq.ai) for more details.
- Please write to [**helpdesk@vortexiq.ai**](mailto:helpdesk@vortexiq.ai) for any support related queries.

### **Analysis:**

- You are currently on the **$49/month plan**, which supports **up to 750 orders per month** (i.e., for past 30 days from the date of subscription)
- Since your usage is **250 orders/month**, you are well within your current plan limits.
- If order volume increases beyond 750, billing will **automatically move** to the next tier ($79/month for up to 2000 orders).
- The pricing model is **usage-based and scalable**, with a **cap** ensuring predictable maximum cost.
- The next invoice (on **Oct 24, 2025**) may **vary** if order volume changes.
