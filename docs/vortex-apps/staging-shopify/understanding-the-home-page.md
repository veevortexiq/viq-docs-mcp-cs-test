# Understanding Home Page


The Home Dashboard is the main overview screen. It lists every Shopify store environment that has been linked inside your assigned VortexIQ Staging tenant, and it shows you what is happening across those environments at a glance.

Use this page to quickly confirm which environments exist (for example, Production, Staging, UAT, Integration1), how recently migrations have run, and whether anything requires attention.

Key buttons and columns:

* ‘View’ button in Front-end column allows you to preview the frontend of the respective Shopify store environment.

* ‘View' button in Control Panel button allows you preview the backend Control Panel of the respective Shopify store environment.

* ‘Add User’ for Git Branch only applies to GitHub integration (a future release)

* ‘Date Created’ shows the date of the latest migration task

* ‘Data Migration & Theme Status’ shows the migration start and end dates/times with progress bar completion

* Clicking on ‘Details’ button shows the migrated entities, counts, migration status and errors (if any)

!!! Tip
    If you are troubleshooting a migration, open Details first. It is the quickest route to entity-level progress and error messages.
